            <title>Why this guide?</title>
            <para>Many people still believe that learning Linux is difficult, or that only experts
                can understand how a Linux system works. Though there is a lot of free documentation
                available, the documentation is widely scattered on the Web, and often confusing,
                since it is usually oriented toward experienced UNIX or Linux users. Today, thanks
                to the advancements in development, Linux has grown in popularity both at home and
                at work. The goal of this guide is to show people of all ages that Linux can be
                simple and fun, and used for all kinds of purposes.</para>

            <title>Who should read this book?</title>
            <para> This guide was created as an overview of the Linux Operating System, geared
                toward new users as an exploration tour and getting started guide, with exercises at
                the end of each chapter. For more advanced trainees it can be a desktop reference,
                and a collection of the base knowledge needed to proceed with system and network
                administration. This book contains many real life examples derived from the author's
                experience as a Linux system and network administrator, trainer and consultant. We
                hope these examples will help you to get a better understanding of the Linux system
                and that you feel encouraged to try out things on your own.</para>
            <para>Everybody who wants to get a <quote>CLUE</quote>, a Command Line User Experience,
                with Linux (and UNIX in general) will find this book useful.</para>

            <para>Also a special thought for Tabatha Marshall for doing a really thorough revision,
                spell check and styling, and to Eugene Crosser for spotting the errors that we two
                looked over.</para>
            <para>And thanks to all the readers who notified me about missing topics and who helped
                to pick out the last errors, unclear definitions and typos by going through the
                trouble of mailing me all their remarks. These are also the people who help me keep
                this guide up to date, like Filipus Klutiero who did a complete review in 2005, and Alexey Eremenko who sent me the foundation for chapter 11.</para>
            <para>Finally, a big thank you for the volunteers who are currently translating this
                document in French, Swedish, German, Farsi, Hindi and more. It is a big work that should
                not be underestimated; I admire your courage.</para>

            <para>An interesting alternative for those who don't dare to take the step of an actual
                Linux installation on their machine are the Linux distributions that you can run

            <title>Organization of this document</title>
            <para>This guide aims to be the foundation for all other materials that you can get from
                The Linux Documentation Project. As such, it provides you with the fundamental
                knowledge needed by anyone who wants to start working with a Linux system, while at
                the same time it tries to consciously avoid re-inventing the hot water. Thus, you
                can expect this book to be incomplete and full of links to sources of additional
                information on your system, on the Internet and in your system documentation.</para>
            <para>The first chapter is an introduction to the subject on Linux; the next two discuss
                absolute basic commands. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss some more advanced but still basic
                topics. Chapter 6 is needed for continuing with the rest, since it discusses editing
                files, an ability you need to pass from Linux newbie to Linux user. The following
                chapters discuss somewhat more advanced topics that you will have to deal with in
                everyday Linux use.</para>
            <para>All chapters come with exercises that will test your preparedness for the next chapter.</para>

<title>History</title>

<sect2 id="sect_01_01_01"><title>UNIX</title>
<para>
In order to understand the popularity of Linux, we need to travel back in time, 
about 30 years ago...  
</para>
<para>Imagine computers as big as houses, even stadiums.  While the sizes of 
those computers posed substantial problems, there was one thing that made this 
even worse:  every computer had a different operating system.  Software was 
always customized to serve a specific purpose, and software for one given system
didn't run on another system.  Being able to work with one system didn't 
automatically mean that you could work with another.  It was difficult, both 
for the users and the system administrators.
</para>
<para>Computers were extremely expensive then, and sacrifices had to be made 
even after the original purchase just to get the users to understand how they 
worked.  The total cost per unit of computing power was enormous.
</para>
<para>Technologically the world was not quite that advanced, so they had to live
with the size for another decade.  In 1969, a team of developers in the Bell 
Labs laboratories started working on a solution for the software problem, to 
address these compatibility issues.  They developed a new operating system, 
which was
</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Simple and elegant.
</para></listitem> 
<listitem><para>Written in the C programming language instead of in assembly 
code.
</para></listitem> 
<listitem><para>Able to recycle code.
</para></listitem> 
</orderedlist>

<para>The Bell Labs developers named their project <quote>UNIX.</quote></para>
<para>
The code recycling features were very important.  Until then, all commercially 
available computer systems were written in a code specifically developed for one
system.  UNIX on the other hand needed only a small piece of that special code, 
which is now commonly named the kernel.  This kernel is the only piece of code 
that needs to be adapted for every specific system and forms the base of the 
UNIX system.  The operating system and all other functions were built around 
this kernel and written in a higher programming language, C.  This language was 
especially developed for creating the UNIX system.  Using this new technique, it
was much easier to develop an operating system that could run on many different 
types of hardware.
</para>
<para>The software vendors were quick to adapt, since they could sell ten times 
more software almost effortlessly.  Weird new situations came in existence:  
imagine for instance computers from different vendors communicating in the same 
network, or users working on different systems without the need for extra 
education to use another computer.  UNIX did a great deal to help users become 
compatible with different systems.
</para>
<para>Throughout the next couple of decades the development of UNIX continued.  
More things became possible to do and more hardware and software vendors added 
support for UNIX to their products.
</para>
<para>UNIX was initially found only in very large environments with mainframes 
and minicomputers (note that a PC is a <quote>micro</quote> computer).  You had 
to work at a university, for the government or for large financial corporations 
in order to get your hands on a UNIX system.
</para>
<para>But smaller computers were being developed, and by the end of the 80's, 
many people had home computers.  By that time, there were several versions of 
UNIX available for the PC architecture, but none of them were truly free and more important: they were all terribly slow, so most people ran MS DOS or Windows 3.1 on their home PCs.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sect_01_01_02"><title>Linus and Linux</title>
<para>By the beginning of the 90s home PCs were finally powerful enough to run a full blown UNIX.  Linus Torvalds, a young man studying computer science at the university of
Helsinki, thought it would be a good idea to have some sort of freely available 
academic version of UNIX, and promptly started to code.  
</para>
<para>He started to ask questions, looking for answers and solutions that would 
help him get UNIX on his PC.  Below is one of his first posts in comp.os.minix, 
dating from 1991:
</para>
<screen>
From: torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI (Linus Benedict Torvalds)
Newsgroups: comp.os.minix
Subject: Gcc-1.40 and a posix-question
Message-ID: &lt;1991Jul3.100050.9886@klaava.Helsinki.FI&gt;
Date: 3 Jul 91 10:00:50 GMT
Hello netlanders,
Due to a project I'm working on (in minix), I'm interested in the posix
standard definition. Could somebody please point me to a (preferably)
machine-readable format of the latest posix rules? Ftp-sites would be
nice.
</screen>
<para>From the start, it was Linus' goal to have a free system that was 
completely compliant with the original UNIX.  That is why he asked for POSIX 
standards, POSIX still being the standard for UNIX.
</para>
<para>In those days plug-and-play wasn't invented yet, but so many people were 
interested in having a UNIX system of their own, that this was only a small 
obstacle.  New drivers became available for all kinds of new hardware, at a 
continuously rising speed.  Almost as soon as a new piece of hardware became 
available, someone bought it and submitted it to the Linux test, as the system 
was gradually being called, releasing more free code for an ever wider range of 
hardware.  These coders didn't stop at their PC's;  every piece of hardware they
could find was useful for Linux.</para>
<para>Back then, those people were called <quote>nerds</quote> or 
<quote>freaks</quote>, but it didn't matter to them, as long as the supported 
hardware list grew longer and longer.  Thanks to these people, Linux is now not 
only ideal to run on new PC's, but is also the system of choice for old and 
exotic hardware that would be useless if Linux didn't exist.
</para>
<para>Two years after Linus' post, there were 12000 Linux users.  The project, 
popular with hobbyists, grew steadily, all the while staying within the bounds 
of the POSIX standard.  All the features of UNIX were added over the next couple
of years, resulting in the mature operating system Linux has become today.  
Linux is a full UNIX clone, fit for use on workstations as well as on 
middle-range and high-end servers.  Today, a lot of the important players on the 
hard- and software market each have their team of Linux developers; at your 
local dealer's you can even buy pre-installed Linux systems with official 
support - eventhough there is still a lot of hard- and software that is not supported, too.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sect_01_01_03">
<title>Current application of Linux systems</title>
<para>Today Linux has joined the desktop market.  Linux developers concentrated 
on networking and services in the beginning, and office applications have been 
the last barrier to be taken down.  We don't like to admit that Microsoft is 
ruling this market, so plenty of alternatives have been started over the last 
couple of years to make Linux an acceptable choice as a workstation, providing 
an easy user interface and MS compatible office applications like word 
processors, spreadsheets, presentations and the like.
</para>
<para>On the server side, Linux is well-known as a stable and reliable platform,
providing database and trading services for companies like Amazon, the 
well-known online bookshop, US Post Office, the German army and such.  
Especially Internet providers and Internet service providers have grown fond of 
Linux as firewall, proxy- and web server, and you will find a Linux box within 
reach of every UNIX system administrator who appreciates a comfortable 
management station.  Clusters of Linux machines are used in the creation of 
movies such as <quote>Titanic</quote>, <quote>Shrek</quote> and others.  In 
post offices, they are the nerve centers that route mail and in large search 
engine, clusters are used to perform internet searches.These are only a few of 
the thousands of heavy-duty jobs that Linux is performing day-to-day across the 
world.
</para>
<para>It is also worth to note that modern Linux not only runs on workstations, 
mid- and high-end servers, but also on <quote>gadgets</quote> like PDA's, 
mobiles, a shipload of embedded applications and even on experimental 
wristwatches.  This makes Linux the only operating system in the world covering 
such a wide range of hardware.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_01_02_01">
<title>Is Linux difficult?</title>
<para>Whether Linux is difficult to learn depends on the person you're asking.  
Experienced UNIX users will say no, because Linux is an ideal operating system 
for power-users and programmers, because it has been and is being developed by 
such people.
</para>
<para>Everything a good programmer can wish for is available: compilers, 
libraries, development and debugging tools.  These packages come with every 
standard Linux distribution.  The C-compiler is included for free - as opposed to many UNIX distributions demanding licensing fees for this tool.  All the 
documentation and manuals are there, and examples are often included to help you
get started in no time.  It feels like UNIX and switching between UNIX and 
Linux is a natural thing.
</para>
<para>In the early days of Linux, being an expert was kind of required to start 
using the system.  Those who mastered Linux felt better than the rest of the 
<quote>lusers</quote> who hadn't seen the light yet.  It was common practice to 
tell a beginning user to <quote>RTFM</quote> (read the manuals).  While the 
manuals were on every system, it was difficult to find the documentation, and 
even if someone did, explanations were in such technical terms that the new user
became easily discouraged from learning the system.
</para>
<para>The Linux-using community started to realize that if Linux was ever to be 
an important player on the operating system market, there had to be some serious
changes in the accessibility of the system.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sect_01_02_02">
<title>Linux for non-experienced users</title>
<para>Companies such as RedHat, SuSE and Mandriva have sprung up, providing 
packaged Linux distributions suitable for mass consumption.  They integrated a 
great deal of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), developed by the community, in 
order to ease management of programs and services.  As a Linux user today you 
have all the means of getting to know your system inside out, but it is no 
longer necessary to have that knowledge in order to make the system comply to 
your requests.
</para>
<para>Nowadays you can log in graphically and start all required applications 
without even having to type a single character, while you still have the ability
to access the core of the system if needed.  Because of its structure, Linux 
allows a user to grow into the system: it equally fits new and experienced 
users.  New users are not forced to do difficult things, while experienced users
are not forced to work in the same way they did when they first started learning
Linux.
</para>
<para>While development in the service area continues, great things are being 
done for desktop users, generally considered as the group least likely to know 
how a system works.  Developers of desktop applications are making incredible 
efforts to make the most beautiful desktops you've ever seen, or to make your 
Linux machine look just like your former MS Windows or MacIntosh workstation.  
The latest developments also include 3D acceleration support and support for USB
devices, single-click updates of system and packages, and so on.  Linux has 
these, and tries to present all available services in a logical form that 
ordinary people can understand.  Below is a short list containing some great 
examples; these sites have a lot of screenshots that will give you a glimpse of 
what Linux on the desktop can be like:

<sect1 id="sect_01_03"><title>Does Linux have a future?</title>
<sect2 id="sect_01_03_01"><title>Open Source</title>
<para>The idea behind Open Source software is rather simple: when programmers 
can read, distribute and change code, the code will mature.  People can adapt 
it, fix it, debug it, and they can do it at a speed that dwarfs the performance 
of software developers at conventional companies.  This software will be more 
flexible and of a better quality than software that has been developed using 
the conventional channels, because more people have tested it in more different 
conditions than the closed software developer ever can.
</para>
<para>The Open Source initiative started to make this clear to the commercial 
world, and very slowly, commercial vendors are starting to see the point.  While
lots of academics and technical people have already been convinced for 20 years 
now that this is the way to go, commercial vendors needed applications like the 
Internet to make them realize they can profit from Open Source.  Now Linux has 
grown past the stage where it was almost exclusively an academic system, useful 
only to a handful of people with a technical background.  Now Linux provides 
more than the operating system: there is an entire infrastructure supporting the
chain of effort of creating an operating system, of making and testing programs 
for it, of bringing everything to the users, of supplying maintenance, updates 
and support and customizations, etcetera.  Today, Linux is ready to accept the 
challenge of a fast-changing world.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sect_01_03_02"><title>Ten years of experience at your service</title>
<para>While Linux is probably the most well-known Open Source initiative, there 
is another project that contributed enormously to the popularity of the Linux 
operating system.  This project is called SAMBA, and its achievement is the 
reverse engineering of the Server Message Block (SMB)/Common Internet File 
System (CIFS) protocol used for file- and print-serving on PC-related machines, 
natively supported by MS Windows NT and OS/2, and Linux.  Packages are now 
available for almost every system and provide interconnection solutions in mixed
environments using MS Windows protocols: Windows-compatible (up to and includingWinXP) file- and print-servers.
</para>
<para>Maybe even more successful than the SAMBA project is the Apache HTTP 
server project.  The server runs on UNIX, Windows NT and many other operating 
systems.  Originally known as <quote>A PAtCHy server</quote>, based on existing 
code and a series of <quote>patch files</quote>, the name for the matured code 
deserves to be connoted with the native American tribe of the Apache, well-known
for their superior skills in warfare strategy and inexhaustible endurance.  
Apache has been shown to be substantially faster, more stable and more 
feature-full than many other web servers.  Apache is run on sites that get 
millions of visitors per day, and while no official support is provided by the 
developers, the Apache user community provides answers to all your questions.  
Commercial support is now being provided by a number of third parties.
</para>
<para>In the category of office applications, a choice of MS Office suite clones
is available, ranging from partial to full implementations of the applications 
available on MS Windows workstations.  These initiatives helped a great deal to 
make Linux acceptable for the desktop market, because the users don't need extra
training to learn how to work with new systems.  With the desktop comes the 
praise of the common users, and not only their praise, but also their specific 
requirements, which are growing more intricate and demanding by the day.
</para>
<para>The Open Source community, consisting largely of people who have been 
contributing for over half a decade, assures Linux' position as an important 
player on the desktop market as well as in general IT application.  Paid 
employees and volunteers alike are working diligently so that Linux can maintain
a position in the market.  The more users, the more questions.  The Open Source 
community makes sure answers keep coming, and watches the quality of the answers
with a suspicious eye, resulting in ever more stability and accessibility.
</para>
<para>Listing all the available Linux software is beyond the scope of this 
guide, as there are tens of thousands of packages.  Throughout this course we 
will present you with the most common packages, which are almost all freely 
available.  In order to take away some of the fear of the beginning user, here's
a screenshot of one of your most-wanted programs.  You can see for yourself that
no effort has been spared to make users who are switching from Windows feel at 
home:

deeply rooted in UNIX, except for the first advantage, of course:

	<listitem>
	<para>Linux is free:</para>
<para>As in free beer, they say.  If you want to spend absolutely nothing, you 
don't even have to pay the price of a CD.  Linux can be downloaded in its 
entirety from the Internet completely for free.  No registration fees, no costs 
per user, free updates, and freely available source code in case you want to 
change the behavior of your system.
</para>
<para>Most of all, Linux is free as in free speech:</para>
<para>The license commonly used is the GNU Public License (GPL).  The license 
says that anybody who may want to do so, has the right to change Linux and 
eventually to redistribute a changed version, on the one condition that the code
is still available after redistribution.  In practice, you are free to grab a 
kernel image, for instance to add support for teletransportation machines or 
time travel and sell your new code, as long as your customers can still have a 
copy of that code.
</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	<para>Linux is portable to any hardware platform:</para>
<para>A vendor who wants to sell a new type of computer and who doesn't know 
what kind of OS his new machine will run (say the CPU in your car or washing 
machine), can take a Linux kernel and make it work on his hardware, because 
documentation related to this activity is freely available.
</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	<para>Linux was made to keep on running:</para>
<para>As with UNIX, a Linux system expects to run without rebooting all the 
time.  That is why a lot of tasks are being executed at night or scheduled 
automatically for other calm moments, resulting in higher availability during 
busier periods and a more balanced use of the hardware.  This property allows 
for Linux to be applicable also in environments where people don't have the time
or the possibility to control their systems night and day.
</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	<para>Linux is secure and versatile:</para>
<para>The security model used in Linux is based on the UNIX idea of security, 
which is known to be robust and of proven quality.  But Linux is not only fit 
for use as a fort against enemy attacks from the Internet:  it will adapt 
equally to other situations, utilizing the same high standards for security.  
Your development machine or control station will be as secure as your firewall.
</para> 
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	<para>Linux is scalable:</para>
<para>From a Palmtop with 2 MB of memory to a petabyte storage cluster with 
hundreds of nodes: add or remove the appropriate packages and Linux fits all.  
You don't need a supercomputer anymore, because you can use Linux to do big 
things using the building blocks provided with the system.  If you want to do 
little things, such as making an operating system for an embedded processor or 
just recycling your old 486, Linux will do that as well.
</para>

        <listitem>
        <para>The Linux OS and quite some Linux applications have very short debug-times:
</para>
<para>Because Linux has been developed and tested by thousands of people, both 
errors and people to fix them are usually found rather quickly.  It sometimes happens that 
there are only a couple of hours between discovery and fixing of a bug.

	<listitem>
	<para>There are far too many different distributions:</para>
<para>"Quot capites, tot rationes", as the Romans already said:  the more 
people, the more opinions.  At first glance, the amount of Linux distributions 
can be frightening, or ridiculous, depending on your point of view.  But it also
means that everyone will find what he or she needs.  You don't need to be an 
expert to find a suitable release.
</para>
<para>When asked, generally every Linux user will say that the best distribution
is the specific version he is using.  So which one should you choose?  Don't 
worry too much about that: all releases contain more or less the same set of 
basic packages.  On top of the basics, special third party software is added 
making, for example, TurboLinux more suitable for the small and medium 
enterprise, RedHat for servers and SuSE for workstations.  However, the 
differences are likely to be very superficial.  The best strategy is to test a 
couple of distributions; unfortunately not everybody has the time for this.  
Luckily, there is plenty of advice on the subject of choosing your Linux.  
A quick search on <ulink url="http://www.google.com/linux">Google</ulink>, using the keywords <quote>choosing your distribution</quote> brings up tens of
links to good advise.

</para>
<para>
It must be said that Linux, at least the core system, is less userfriendly to use than MS Windows and certainly more difficult than MacOS, but...  
In light of its popularity, considerable effort has been made to make Linux 
even easier to use, especially for new users. More information is being released
daily, such as this guide, to help fill the gap for documentation available to
users at all levels.

        <para>Is an Open Source product trustworthy?</para>
<para>How can something that is free also be reliable?  Linux users have the 
choice whether to use Linux or not, which gives them an enormous advantage 
compared to users of proprietary software, who don't have that kind of freedom. 
After long periods of testing, most Linux users come to the conclusion that 
Linux is not only as good, but in many cases better and faster that the 
traditional solutions.  If Linux were not trustworthy, it would have been long 
gone, never knowing the popularity it has now, with millions of users.  Now 
users can influence their systems and share their remarks with the community, 
so the system gets better and better every day.  It is a project that is never 
finished, that is true, but in an ever changing environment, Linux is also a 
project that continues to strive for perfection.

<sect2 id="sect_01_05_01"><title>Linux and GNU</title>

<para>
Although there are a large number of Linux implementations, you will find a lot 
of similarities in the different distributions, if only because every Linux 
machine is a box with building blocks that you may put together following your 
own needs and views.  Installing the system is only the beginning of a longterm 
relationship.  Just when you think you have a nice running system, Linux will 
stimulate your imagination and creativeness, and the more you realize what 
power the system can give you, the more you will try to redefine its limits. 
</para>
<para>Linux may appear different depending on the distribution, your hardware 
and personal taste, but the fundamentals on which all graphical and other 
interfaces are built, remain the same.  The Linux system is based on GNU tools 
(Gnu's Not UNIX), which provide a set of standard ways to handle and use the 
system.  All GNU tools are open source, so they can be installed on any system. 
Most distributions offer pre-compiled packages of most common tools, such as RPM
packages on RedHat and Debian packages (also called deb or dpkg) on Debian, so you needn't be a programmer 
to install a package on your system.  However, if you are and like doing things 
yourself, you will enjoy Linux all the better, since most distributions come 
with a complete set of development tools, allowing installation of new software 
purely from source code.  This setup also allows you to install software even if
it does not exist in a pre-packaged form suitable for your system.

<para>Many commercial applications are available for Linux, and for more 
information about these packages we refer to their specific documentation.  
Throughout this guide we will only discuss freely available software, which 
comes (in most cases) with a GNU license.
</para>
<para>To install missing or new packages, you will need some form of software 
management.  The most common implementations include RPM, dpkg and Ximian Red 
Carpet.  RPM is the RedHat Package Manager, which is used on a variety of Linux 
systems, eventhough the name does not suggest this.  Dpkg is the Debian package 
management system, which uses an interface called <command>apt-get</command>, 
that can manage RPM packages as well.  Ximian Red Carpet is a third party 
implementation of RPM with a graphical front-end.  Other third party software 
vendors may have their own installation procedures, sometimes resembling the 
InstallShield and such, as known on MS Windows and other platforms.  As you 
advance into Linux, you will likely get in touch with one or more of these 
programs.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_01_05_02"><title>GNU/Linux</title>
<para>The Linux kernel (the <emphasis>bones</emphasis> of your system, see 
<xref linkend="sect_03_02_03_01"></xref>) is not part of the GNU project but uses the
same license as GNU software.  A great majority of utilities and development 
tools (the <emphasis>meat</emphasis> of your system), which are not 
Linux-specific, are taken from the GNU project.  Because any usable system must 
contain both the kernel and at least a minimal set of utilities, some people 
argue that such a system should be called a <emphasis>GNU/Linux</emphasis> 
system.
</para>
<para>In order to obtain the highest possible degree of independence between 
distributions, this is the sort of Linux that we will discuss throughout this 
course.  If we are not talking about a GNU/Linux system, the specific 
distribution, version or program name will be mentioned.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_01_05_03"><title>Which distribution should I install?</title>
<para>Prior to installation, the most important factor is your hardware.  Since 
every Linux distribution contains the basic packages and can be built to meet 
almost any requirement (because they all use the Linux kernel), you only need to
consider if the distribution will run on your hardware.  LinuxPPC for example 
has been made to run on MacIntosh and other PowerPCs and does not run on an 
ordinary x86 based PC.  LinuxPPC does run on the new Macs, but you can't use it 
for some of the older ones with ancient bus technology.  Another tricky case is 
Sun hardware, which could be an old SPARC CPU or a newer UltraSparc, both 
requiring different versions of Linux.</para>
<para>Some Linux distributions are optimized for certain processors, such as 
Athlon CPUs, while they will at the same time run decent enough on the standard 
486, 586 and 686 Intel processors.  Sometimes distributions for special CPUs 
are not as reliable, since they are tested by fewer people.
</para>
<para>Most Linux distributions offer a set of programs for generic PCs with 
special packages containing optimized kernels for the x86 Intel based CPUs.  
These distributions are well-tested and maintained on a regular basis, focusing 
on reliant server implementation and easy installation and update procedures.  
Examples are Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, SuSE and Mandriva, which are by far the most popular Linux 
systems and generally considered easy to handle for the beginning user, while 
not blocking professionals from getting the most out of their Linux machines.  
Linux also runs decently on laptops and middle-range servers.  Drivers for new 
hardware are included only after extensive testing, which adds to the stability 
of a system.</para>
<para>While the standard desktop might be Gnome on one system, another might 
offer KDE by default.  Generally, both Gnome and KDE are available for all major Linux distributions.   Other window and desktop managers are available for more advanced users.</para>
<para>The standard installation process allows users to choose between different basic
setups, such as a workstation, where all packages needed for everyday use and 
development are installed, or a server installation, where different network 
services can be selected.  Expert users can install every combination of 
packages they want during the initial installation process.
</para>
<para>The goal of this guide is to apply to all Linux distributions.  For your 
own convenience, however, it is strongly advised that beginners stick to a 
mainstream distribution, supporting all common hardware and applications by 
default.  The following are very good choices for novices:

<sect1 id="sect_02_01"><title>Logging in, activating the user interface and 
logging out</title>
<sect2 id="sect_02_01_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>In order to work on a Linux system directly, you will need to provide a 
user name and password.  You always need to authenticate to the system.  As we 
already mentioned in the exercise from <xref linkend="chap_01"></xref>, most PC-based
Linux systems have two basic modes for a system to run in: either quick and 
sober in text console mode, which looks like DOS with mouse, multitasking and 
multi-user features, or in graphical mode, which looks better but eats 
more system resources.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_02_01_02"><title>Graphical mode</title>
<para>This is the default nowadays on most desktop computers.  You know you will connect to the system using graphical mode when you are first asked for your user name, and then, in a new window, to type your password.</para>
<para>To log in, make sure the mouse pointer is in the login window, provide your user name and password to the system and click <guibutton>OK</guibutton> or press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.</para>
<warning><title>Careful with that root account!</title>
<para>It is generally considered a bad idea to connect (graphically) using the <emphasis>root</emphasis> user name, the system adminstrator's account, since the use of graphics includes running a lot of extra programs, in root's case with a lot of extra permissions.  To keep all risks as low as possible, use a normal user account to connect graphically.  But there are enough risks to keep this in mind as a general advice, for all use of the root account: only log in as root when extra privileges are required.</para>
</warning>
<para>After entering your user name/password combination, it can take a little while before the graphical environment is started, depending on the CPU speed of your computer, on the software you use and on your personal settings.</para>
<para>To continue, you will need to open a <emphasis>terminal window</emphasis> or <emphasis>xterm</emphasis> for short (X being the name for the underlying software supporting the graphical environment).  This program can be found in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Applications</guimenu><guimenuitem>Utilities</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, <menuchoice><guimenuitem>System Tools</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Internet</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu, depending on what window manager you are using.  There might be icons that you can use as a shortcut to get an xterm window as well, and clicking the right mouse button on the desktop background will usually present you with a menu containing a terminal window application.</para>
<para>While browsing the menus, you will notice that a lot of things can be done without entering commands via the keyboard.  For most users, the good old point-'n'-click method of dealing with the computer will do.  But this guide is for future network and system administrators, who will need to meddle with the heart of the system.  They need a stronger tool than a mouse to handle all the tasks they will face.  This tool is the shell, and when in graphical mode, we activate our shell by opening a terminal window.</para>
<para>The terminal window is your control panel for the system.  Almost everything that follows is done using this simple but powerful text tool.  A terminal window should always show a command prompt when you open one.  This terminal shows a standard prompt, which displays the user's login name, and the current working directory, represented by the twiddle (<filename>~</filename>):</para>

</mediaobject>
</figure>
<para>Another common form for a prompt is this one:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[user@host dir]</prompt>
</screen>
<para>In the above example, <emphasis>user</emphasis> will be your login name, <emphasis>hosts</emphasis> the name of the machine you are working on, and <emphasis>dir</emphasis> an indication of your current location in the file system.</para>
<para>Later we will discuss prompts and their behavior in detail.  For now, it suffices to know that prompts can display all kinds of information, but that they are not part of the commands you are giving to your system.</para>
<para>To disconnect from the system in graphical mode, you need to close all terminal windows and other applications.  After that, hit the logout icon or find <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Log Out</guimenuitem></menuchoice> in the menu.  Closing everything is not really necessary, and the system can do this for you, but session management might put all currently open applications back on your screen when you connect again, which takes longer and is not always the desired effect.  However, this behavior is configurable.</para>
<para>When you see the login screen again, asking to enter user name and password, logout was successful.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sect_02_01_03"><title>Text mode</title>
<para>You know you're in text mode when the whole screen is black, showing (in most cases white) characters.  A text mode login screen typically shows some information about the machine you are working on, the name of the machine and a prompt waiting for you to log in:</para>

<screen>

RedHat Linux Release 8.0 (Psyche)

blast login: _




</screen>
<para>The login is different from a graphical login, in that you have to hit the <keycap>Enter</keycap> key after providing your user name, because there are no buttons on the screen that you can click with the mouse.  Then you should type your password, followed by another <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  You won't see any indication that you are entering something, not even an asterisk, and you won't see the cursor move.  But this is normal on Linux and is done for security reasons.</para>
<para>When the system has accepted you as a valid user, you may get some more information, called the <emphasis>message of the day</emphasis>, which can be anything.  Additionally, it is popular on UNIX systems to display a fortune cookie, which contains some general wise or unwise (this is up to you) thoughts.  After that, you will be given a shell, indicated with the same prompt that you would get in graphical mode.</para>
<warning><title>Don't log in as root</title>
<para>Also in text mode: log in as root only to do setup and configuration that absolutely requires administrator privileges, such as adding users, installing software packages, and performing network and other system configuration.  Once you are finished, immediately leave the special account and resume your work as a non-privileged user.</para>
</warning>

<para>Logging out is done by entering the <command>logout</command> command, followed by <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  You are successfully disconnected from the system when you see the login screen again.</para>
<caution><title>Don't hit the power button!</title>
<para>Don't power-off the computer after logging out.  It is not meant to be shut off without application of the proper procedures for halting the system.  Powering it off without going through the halting process might cause severe damage!  For now, use the <menuchoice><guimenu>Shut down</guimenu></menuchoice> option when you log out from the graphical interface, or, when on the login screen (where you have to give your user name and password) look around for a shutdown button.</para></caution>
<para>Now that we know how to connect to and disconnect from the system, we're ready for our first commands.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_02_02_02"><title>General remarks</title>
<para>You type these commands after the prompt, in a terminal window in graphical mode or in text mode, followed by <keycap>Enter</keycap>.</para>
<para>Commands can be issued by themselves, such as <command>ls</command>.  A command behaves different when you specify an <emphasis>option</emphasis>, usually preceded with a dash (-), as in <command>ls -a</command>.  The same option character may have a different meaning for another command.  GNU programs take long options, preceded by two dashes (--), like <command>ls --all</command>.  Some commands have no options.</para>
<para>The argument(s) to a command are specifications for the object(s) on which you want the command to take effect.  An example is <command>ls <parameter>/etc</parameter></command>, where the directory <filename>/etc</filename> is the argument to the <command>ls</command> command.  This indicates that you want to see the content of that directory, instead of the default, which would be the content of the current directory, obtained by just typing <command>ls</command> followed by <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  Some commands require arguments, sometimes arguments are optional.</para>
<para>You can find out whether a command takes options and arguments, and which ones are valid, by checking the online help for that command, see <xref linkend="sect_02_03"></xref>.</para>
<para>In Linux, like in UNIX, directories are separated using forward slashes, like the ones used in web addresses (URLs).  We will discuss directory structure in-depth later.</para>
<para>The symbols . and .. have special meaning when directories are concerned.  We will try to find out about those during the exercises, and more in the next chapter.</para>
<para>Try to avoid logging in with or using the system administrator's account, <emphasis>root</emphasis>.  Besides doing your normal work, most tasks, including checking the system, collecting information etc., can be executed using a normal user account with no special permissions at all.  If needed, for instance when creating a new user or installing new software, the preferred way of obtaining root access is by switching user IDs, see <xref linkend="sect_03_02_01"></xref> for an example.</para>  
<para>Almost all commands in this book can be executed without system administrator privileges.  In most cases, when issuing a command or starting a program as a non-privileged user, the system will warn you or prompt you for the root password when root access is required.  Once you're done, leave the application or session that gives you root privileges immediately.</para>
<para>Reading documentation should become your second nature.  Especially in the beginning, it is important to read system documentation, manuals for basic commands, HOWTOs and so on.  Since the amount of documentation is so enormous, it is impossible to include all related documentation.  This book will try to guide you to the most appropriate documentation on every subject discussed, in order to stimulate the habit of reading the man pages.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_02_02_03"><title>Using Bash features</title>

<para>The last two items in the above table may need some extra explanantions.  For instance, if you want to change into the directory <filename>directory_with_a_very_long_name</filename>, you are not going to type that very long name, no.  You just type on the command line <command>cd dir</command>, then you press <keycap>Tab</keycap> and the shell completes the name for you, if no other files are starting with the same three characters.  Of course, if there are no other items starting with <quote>d</quote>, then you might just as wel type <command>cd d</command> and then <keycap>Tab</keycap>.  If more than one file starts with the same characters, the shell will signal this to you, upon which you can hit <keycap>Tab</keycap> twice with short interval, and the shell presents the choices you have:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>your_prompt&gt;</prompt> <command>cd st</command>
starthere	 stuff		stuffit
</screen>
<para>In the above example, if you type <quote>a</quote> after the first two characters and hit <keycap>Tab</keycap> again, no other possibilities are left, and the shell completes the directory name, without you having to type the string <quote>rthere</quote>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>your_prompt&gt;</prompt> <command>cd starthere</command>
</screen>
<para>Of course, you'll still have to hit <keycap>Enter</keycap> to accept this choice.</para>
<para>In the same example, if you type <quote>u</quote>, and then hit <keycap>Tab</keycap>, the shell will add the <quote>ff</quote> for you, but then it protests again, because multiple choices are possible.  If you type <keycap>Tab</keycap> <keycap>Tab</keycap> again, you'll see the choices; if you type one or more characters that make the choice unambiguous to the system, and <keycap>Tab</keycap> again, or <keycap>Enter</keycap> when you've reach the end of the file name that you want to choose, the shell completes the file name and changes you into that directory - if indeed it is a directory name.</para>
<para>This works for all file names that are arguments to commands.</para>
<para>The same goes for command name completion.  Typing <command>ls</command> and then hitting the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key twice, lists all the commands in your <varname>PATH</varname> (see <xref linkend="sect_03_02_01"></xref>) that start with these two characters:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>your_prompt&gt;</prompt> <command>ls</command>
ls           lsdev        lspci        lsraid       lsw

<sect2 id="sect_02_03_01"><title>Be warned</title>
<para>GNU/Linux is all about becoming more self-reliant.  And as usual with this system, there are several ways to achieve the goal.  A common way of getting help is finding someone who knows, and however patient and peace-loving the Linux-using community will be, almost everybody will expect you to have tried one or more of the methods in this section before asking them, and the ways in which this viewpoint is expressed may be rather harsh if you prove not to have followed this basic rule.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_02_03_02"><title>The man pages</title>
<para>A lot of beginning users fear the man (manual) pages, because they are an overwhelming source of documentation.  They are, however, very structured, as you will see from the example below on: <command>man <option>man</option></command>.</para>
<para>Reading man pages is usually done in a terminal window when in graphical mode, or just in text mode if you prefer it.  Type the command like this at the prompt, followed by <keycap>Enter</keycap>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>yourname@yourcomp ~&gt;</prompt> <command>man <parameter>man</parameter></command>
</screen>
<para>The documentation for <command>man</command> will be displayed on your screen after you press <keycap>Enter</keycap>:</para>  
<screen>
man(1)                                                         man(1)



NAME
 man - format and display the on-line manual pages
 manpath - determine user's search path for man pages

SYNOPSIS
 man [-acdfFhkKtwW] [--path] [-m system] [-p string] [-C config_file]
 [-M pathlist] [-P pager] [-S section_list] [section] name ...


DESCRIPTION
 man formats and displays the on-line manual pages.  If you specify
 section, man only looks in that section of the manual.  
 name is normally the name of the manual page, which is typically the 
 name of a  command, function, or file.  However, if name contains a 
 slash (/) then man interprets it as a file specification, so that you
 can do man ./foo.5 or even man /cd/foo/bar.1.gz.

 See  below  for  a  description  of where man looks for the manual
 page files.

OPTIONS
 -C  config_file
lines 1-27
</screen>
<para>Browse to the next page using the space bar.  You can go back to the previous page using the b-key.  When you reach the end, <command>man</command> will usually quit and you get the prompt back.  Type <keycap>q</keycap> if you want to leave the man page before reaching the end, or if the viewer does not quit automatically at the end of the page.</para>
<note><title>Pagers</title>
<para>The available key combinations for manipulating the man pages depend on the <emphasis>pager</emphasis> used in your distribution.  Most distributions use <command>less</command> to view the man pages and to scroll around.  See <xref linkend="sect_03_03_04_02"></xref> for more info on pagers.</para>
</note>
<para>Each man page usually contains a couple of standard sections, as we can see from the <command>man <option>man</option></command> example:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The first line contains the name of the command you are reading about, and the id of the section in which this man page is located.  The man pages are ordered in chapters.  Commands are likely to have multiple man pages, for example the man page from the user section, the man page from the system admin section, and the man page from the programmer section.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The name of the command and a short description are given, which is used for building an index of the man pages.  You can look for any given search string in this index using the <command>apropos</command> command.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The synopsis of the command provides a technical notation of all the options and/or arguments this command can take.  You can think of an option as a way of executing the command.  The argument is what you execute it on.  Some commands have no options or no arguments.  Optional options and arguments are put in between <quote>[</quote> and <quote>]</quote> to indicate that they can be left out.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A longer description of the command is given.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Options with their descriptions are listed.  Options can usually be combined.  If not so, this section will tell you about it.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Environment describes the shell variables that influence the behavior of this command (not all commands have this).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Sometimes sections specific to this command are provided, such as the CAT PAGES section in the example.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>A reference to other man pages is given in the <quote>SEE ALSO</quote> section.  In between parentheses is the number of the man page section in which to find this command.  Experienced users often switch to the <quote>SEE ALSO</quote> part using the <command>/</command> command followed by the search string <literal>SEE</literal> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Usually there is also information about known bugs (anomalies) and where to report new bugs you may find.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>There might also be author and copyright information.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Some commands have multiple man pages.  For instance, the <command>passwd</command> command has a man page in section 1 and another in section 5.  By default, the man page with the lowest number is shown.  If you want to see another section than the default, specify it after the <command>man</command> command:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>man <option>5</option> <parameter>passwd</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>If you want to see all man pages about a command, one after the other, use the <option>-a</option> to man:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>man <option>-a</option> <parameter>passwd</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>This way, when you reach the end of the first man page and press <keycap>SPACE</keycap> again, the man page from the next section will be displayed.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_02_03_03_01"><title>The Info pages</title>
<para>In addition to the man pages, you can read the info pages about a command, using the <command>info</command> command.  These usually contain more recent information and are somewhat easier to use.  The man pages for some commands refer to the info pages.</para>

Info: An Introduction
*********************

   Info is a program, which you are using now, for reading
documentation of computer programs.  The GNU Project distributes most
of its on-line manuals in the Info format, so you need a program called
"Info reader" to read the manuals.  One of such programs you are using
now.

   If you are new to Info and want to learn how to use it, type the
command `h' now.  It brings you to a programmed instruction sequence.

   To learn advanced Info commands, type `n' twice.  This brings you to
`Info for Experts', skipping over the `Getting Started' chapter.

* Menu:

* Getting Started::             Getting started using an Info reader.
* Advanced Info::               Advanced commands within Info.
* Creating an Info File::       How to make your own Info file.
--zz-Info: (info.info.gz)Top, 24 lines --Top-------------------------------
Welcome to Info version 4.2. Type C-h for help, m for menu item.
</screen>
<para>Use the arrow keys to browse through the text and move the cursor on a line starting with an asterisk, containing the keyword about which you want info, then hit <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  Use the <keycap>P</keycap> and <keycap>N</keycap> keys to go to the previous or next subject.  The space bar will move you one page further, no matter whether this starts a new subject or an info page for another command.  Use <keycap>Q</keycap> to quit.  The <command>info</command> program has more information.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_02_03_03_02"><title>The whatis and apropos commands</title>
<para>A short index of explanations for commands is available using the <command>whatis</command> command, like in the examples below:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[your_prompt]</prompt> <command>whatis ls</command>
ls                   (1)  - list directory contents
</screen>
<para>This displays short information about a command, and the first section in the collection of man pages that contains an appropriate page.</para>
<para>If you don't know where to get started and which man page to read, <command>apropos</command> gives more information.  Say that you don't know how to start a browser, then you could enter the following command:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>another prompt&gt;</prompt> <command>apropos browser</command>
Galeon [galeon](1)  - gecko-based GNOME web browser
lynx           (1)  - a general purpose distributed information browser 
	            for the World Wide Web
ncftp          (1)  - Browser program for the File Transfer Protocol
opera          (1)  - a graphical web browser
pilot          (1)  - simple file system browser in the style of the 
		    Pine Composer
pinfo          (1)  - curses based lynx-style info browser
pinfo [pman]   (1)  - curses based lynx-style info browser
viewres        (1x)  - graphical class browser for Xt
</screen>
<para>After pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap> you will see that a lot of browser related stuff is on your machine: not only web browsers, but also file and FTP browsers, and browsers for documentation.  If you have development packages installed, you may also have the accompanying man pages dealing with writing programs having to do with browsers.  Generally, a command with a man page in section one, so one marked with <quote>(1)</quote>, is suitable for trying out as a user.  The user who issued the above <command>apropos</command> might consequently try to start the commands <command>galeon</command>, <command>lynx</command> or <command>opera</command>, since these clearly have to do with browsing the world wide web.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_02_03_03_03"><title>The --help option</title>
<para>Most GNU commands support the <option>--help</option>, which gives a short explanation about how to use the command and a list of available options.  Below is the output of this option with the <command>cat</command> command:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>userprompt@host:</prompt> <command>cat --help</command>
Usage: cat [OPTION] [FILE]...
Concatenate FILE(s), or standard input, to standard output.

  -A, --show-all           equivalent to -vET
  -b, --number-nonblank    number nonblank output lines
  -e                       equivalent to -vE
  -E, --show-ends          display $ at end of each line
  -n, --number             number all output lines
  -s, --squeeze-blank      never more than one single blank line
  -t                       equivalent to -vT
  -T, --show-tabs          display TAB characters as ^I
  -u                       (ignored)
  -v, --show-nonprinting   use ^ and M- notation, 
			   except for LFD and TAB
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Report bugs to &lt;bug-textutils@gnu.org&gt;.

<sect3 id="sect_02_03_04"><title>Graphical help</title>
<para>Don't despair if you prefer a graphical user interface.  Konqueror, the default KDE file manager, provides painless and colourful access to the man and Info pages.  You may want to try <quote>info:info</quote> in the <emphasis>Location</emphasis> address bar, and you will get a browsable Info page about the <command>info</command> command.  Similarly, <quote>man:ls</quote> will present you with the man page for the <command>ls</command> command.  You even get command name completion: you will see the man pages for all the commands starting with <quote>ls</quote> in a scroll-down menu.  Entering <quote>info:/dir</quote> in the address location toolbar displays all the Info pages, arranged in utility categories.  Excellent <menuchoice><guimenu>Help</guimenu></menuchoice> content, including the Konqueror Handbook.  Start up from the menu or by typing the command <command>konqueror</command> in a terminal window, followed by <keycap>Enter</keycap>; see the screenshot below.</para>

<figure><title>Konqueror as help browser</title>

<para>The Gnome Help Browser is very user friendly as well.  You can start it selecting <menuchoice><guimenu>Applications</guimenu><guimenuitem>Help</guimenuitem></menuchoice> from the Gnome menu, by clicking the lifeguard icon on your desktop or by entering the command <command>gnome-help</command> in a terminal window.  The system documentation and man pages are easily browsable with a plain interface.</para>
<para>The <command>nautilus</command> file manager provides a searchable index of the man and Info pages, they are easily browsable and interlinked.  Nautilus is started from the command line, or clicking your home directory icon, or from the Gnome menu.</para>
<para>The big advantage of GUIs for system documentation is that all information is completely interlinked, so you can click through in the <quote>SEE ALSO</quote> sections and wherever links to other man pages appear, and thus browse and acquire knowledge without interruption for hours at the time.</para> 
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_02_03_05"><title>Exceptions</title>
<para>Some commands don't have separate documentation, because they are part of another command.  <command>cd</command>, <command>exit</command>, <command>logout</command> and <command>pwd</command> are such exceptions.  They are part of your shell program and are called <emphasis>shell built-in</emphasis> commands.  For information about these, refer to the man or info page of your shell.  Most beginning Linux users have a Bash shell.  See <xref linkend="sect_03_02_03_02"></xref> for more about shells.</para>
<para>If you have been changing your original system configuration, it might also be possible that man pages are still there, but not visible because your shell environment has changed.  In that case, you will need to check the <varname>MANPATH</varname> variable.  How to do this is explained in <xref linkend="sect_07_02_02"></xref>.</para>
<para>Some programs or packages only have a set of instructions or references in the directory <filename>/usr/share/doc</filename>.  See <xref linkend="sect_03_03_04"></xref> to display.</para>
<para>In the worst case, you may have removed the documentation from your system by accident (hopefully by accident, because it is a very bad idea to do this on purpose).  In that case, first try to make sure that there is really nothing appropriate left using a search tool, read on in <xref linkend="sect_03_03_03"></xref>.  If so, you may have to re-install the package that contains the command to which the documentation applied, see <xref linkend="sect_07_06"></xref>.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_02_04"><title>Summary</title>
<para>Linux traditionally operates in text mode or in graphical mode.  Since CPU power and RAM are not the cost anymore these days, every Linux user can afford to work in graphical mode and will usually do so.  This does not mean that you don't have to know about text mode: we will work in the text environment throughout this course, using a terminal window.</para>
<para>Linux encourages its users to acquire knowledge and to become independent.  Inevitably, you will have to read a lot of documentation to achieve that goal; that is why, as you will notice, we refer to extra documentation for almost every command, tool and problem listed in this book.  The more docs you read, the easier it will become and the faster you will leaf through manuals.  Make reading documentation a habit as soon as possible.  When you don't know the answer to a problem, refering to the documentation should become a second nature.</para>

<title>About files and the file system</title>
<abstract>
<para>After the initial exploration in <xref linkend="chap_02"></xref>, we are ready to discuss the files and directories on a Linux system in more detail.  Many users have difficulties with Linux because they lack an overview of what kind of data is kept in which locations.  We will try to shine some light on the organization of files in the file system.
</para>
<para>We will also list the most important files and directories and use different methods of viewing the content of those files, and learn how files and directories can be created, moved and deleted.</para>
<para>After completion of the exercises in this chapter, you will be able to:</para>

<sect2 id="sect_03_01_01"><title>Files</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_01_01_01"><title>General</title>
<para>A simple description of the UNIX system, also applicable to Linux, is this:</para>
<para><quote>On a UNIX system, everything is a file; if something is not a file, it is a process.</quote></para>
<para>This statement is true because there are special files that are more than just files (named pipes and sockets, for instance), but to keep things simple, saying that everything is a file is an acceptable generalization.  A Linux system, just like UNIX, makes no difference between a file and a directory, since a directory is just a file containing names of other files.  Programs, services, texts, images, and so forth, are all files.  Input and output devices, and generally all devices, are considered to be files, according to the system.</para>
<para>In order to manage all those files in an orderly fashion, man likes to think of them in an ordered tree-like structure on the hard disk, as we know from MS-DOS (Disk Operating System) for instance.  The large branches contain more branches, and the branches at the end contain the tree's leaves or normal files.  For now we will use this image of the tree, but we will find out later why this is not a fully accurate image.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_01_01_02"><title>Sorts of files</title>
<para>Most files are just files, called <emphasis>regular</emphasis> files; they contain normal data, for example text files, executable files or programs, input for or output from a program and so on.</para>
<para>While it is reasonably safe to suppose that everything you encounter on a Linux system is a file, there are some exceptions.</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Directories</emphasis>: files that are lists of other files.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Special files</emphasis>: the mechanism used for input and output.  Most special files are in <filename>/dev</filename>, we will discuss them later.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Links</emphasis>: a system to make a file or directory visible in multiple parts of the system's file tree.  We will talk about links in detail.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>(Domain) sockets</emphasis>: a special file type, similar to TCP/IP sockets, providing inter-process networking protected by the file system's access control.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>Named pipes</emphasis>: act more or less like sockets and form a way for processes to communicate with each other, without using network socket semantics.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The <option>-l</option> option to <command>ls</command> displays the file type, using the first character of each input line:</para>

<para>In order not to always have to perform a long listing for seeing the file type, a lot of systems by default don't issue just <command>ls</command>, but <command>ls <option>-F</option></command>, which suffixes file names with one of the characters <quote>/=*|@</quote> to indicate the file type.  To make it extra easy on the beginning user, both the <option>-F</option> and <option>--color</option> options are usually combined, see <xref linkend="sect_03_03_01_01"></xref>.  We will use <command>ls <option>-F</option></command> throughout this document for better readability.</para>

<para>As a user, you only need to deal directly with plain files, executable files, directories and links.  The special file types are there for making your system do what you demand from it and are dealt with by system administrators and programmers.</para>


<para>
Now, before we look at the important files and directories, we need to know more about partitions.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_03_01_02"><title>About partitioning</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_01_02_01"><title>Why partition?</title>
<para>Most people have a vague knowledge of what partitions are, since every operating system has the ability to create or remove them.  It may seem strange that Linux uses more than one partition on the same disk, even when using the standard installation procedure, so some explanation is called for.</para>
<para>One of the goals of having different partitions is to achieve higher data security in case of disaster.  By dividing the hard disk in partitions, data can be grouped and separated.  When an accident occurs, only the data in the partition that got the hit will be damaged, while the data on the other partitions will most likely survive. </para>
<para>This principle dates from the days when Linux didn't have journaled file systems and power failures might have lead to disaster.  The use of partitions remains for security and robustness reasons, so a breach on one part of the system doesn't automatically mean that the whole computer is in danger.  This is currently the most important reason for partitioning.  A simple example: a user creates a script, a program or a web application that starts filling up the disk.  If the disk contains only one big partition, the entire system will stop functioning if the disk is full.  If the user stores the data on a separate partition, then only that (data) partition will be affected, while the system partitions and possible other data partitions keep functioning.</para>
<para>Mind that having a journaled file system only provides data security in case of power failure and sudden disconnection of storage devices.  This does not protect your data against bad blocks and logical errors in the file system.  In those cases, you should use a RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) solution.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_01_02_02"><title>Partition layout and types</title>
<para>There are two kinds of major partitions on a Linux system:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>data partition</emphasis>: normal Linux system data, including the <emphasis>root partition</emphasis> containing all the data to start up and run the system; and </para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>swap partition</emphasis>: expansion of the computer's physical memory, extra memory on hard disk.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Most systems contain a root partition, one or more data partitions and one or more swap partitions.  Systems in mixed environments may contain partitions for other system data, such as a partition with a FAT or VFAT file system for MS Windows data.</para>
<para>Most Linux systems use <command>fdisk</command> at installation time to set the partition type.  As you may have noticed during the exercise from Chapter 1, this usually happens automatically.  On some occasions, however, you may not be so lucky.  In such cases, you will need to select the partition type manually and even manually do the actual partitioning.  The standard Linux partitions have number 82 for swap and 83 for data, which can be journaled (ext3) or normal (ext2, on older systems).  The <command>fdisk</command> utility has built-in help, should you forget these values.</para>
<para>Apart from these two, Linux supports a variety of other file system types, such as the relatively new Reiser file system, JFS, NFS, FATxx and many other file systems natively available on other (proprietary) operating systems.</para>

<para>The standard root partition (indicated with a single forward slash, <emphasis>/</emphasis>) is about 100-500 MB, and contains the system configuration files, most basic commands and server programs, system libraries, some temporary space and the home directory of the administrative user.  A standard installation requires about 250 MB for the root partition.</para>
<para>Swap space (indicated with <emphasis>swap</emphasis>) is only accessible for the system itself, and is hidden from view during normal operation.  Swap is the system that ensures, like on normal UNIX systems, that you can keep on working, whatever happens.  On Linux, you will virtually never see irritating messages like <emphasis>Out of memory, please close some applications first and try again</emphasis>, because of this extra memory.  The swap or virtual memory procedure has long been adopted by operating systems outside the UNIX world by now.</para>
<para>Using memory on a hard disk is naturally slower than using the real memory chips of a computer, but having this little extra is a great comfort.  We will learn more about swap when we discuss Processes in <xref linkend="chap_04"></xref>.</para>
<para>Linux generally counts on having twice the amount of physical memory in the form of swap space on the hard disk.  When installing a system, you have to know how you are going to do this.  An example on a system with 512 MB of RAM:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>1st possibility: one swap partition of 1 GB</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>2nd possibility: two swap partitions of 512 MB</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>3rd possibility: with two hard disks: 1 partition of 512 MB on each disk.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The last option will give the best results when a lot of I/O is to be expected.</para>
<para>Read the software documentation for specific guidelines.  Some applications, such as databases, might require more swap space.  Others, such as some handheld systems, might not have any swap at all by lack of a hard disk.  Swap space may also depend on your kernel version.</para>
<para>The kernel is on a separate partition as well in many distributions, because it is the most important file of your system.  If this is the case, you will find that you also have a <emphasis>/boot</emphasis> partition, holding your kernel(s) and accompanying data files.</para>
<para>The rest of the hard disk(s) is generally divided in data partitions, although it may be that all of the non-system critical data resides on one partition, for example when you perform a standard workstation installation.  When non-critical data is separated on different partitions, it usually happens following a set pattern:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>a partition for user programs (<emphasis>/usr</emphasis>)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a partition containing the users' personal data (<emphasis>/home</emphasis>)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a partition to store temporary data like print- and mail-queues (<emphasis>/var</emphasis>)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a partition for third party and extra software (<emphasis>/opt</emphasis>)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Once the partitions are made, you can only add more.  Changing sizes or properties of existing partitions is possible but not advisable.</para>
<para>The division of hard disks into partitions is determined by the system administrator.  On larger systems, he or she may even spread one partition over several hard disks, using the appropriate software.  Most distributions allow for standard setups optimized for workstations (average users) and for general server purposes, but also accept customized partitions.  During the installation process you can define your own partition layout using either your distribution specific tool, which is usually a straight forward graphical interface, or <command>fdisk</command>, a text-based tool for creating partitions and setting their properties.</para>
<para>A workstation or client installation is for use by mainly one and the same person.  The selected software for installation reflects this and the stress is on common user packages, such as nice desktop themes, development tools, client programs for E-mail, multimedia software, web and other services.  Everything is put together on one large partition, swap space twice the amount of RAM is added and your generic workstation is complete, providing the largest amount of disk space possible for personal use, but with the disadvantage of possible data integrity loss during problem situations.</para>
<para>On a server, system data tends to be separate from user data.  Programs that offer services are kept in a different place than the data handled by this service.  Different partitions will be created on such systems:</para>
<itemizedlist> 
<listitem><para>a partition with all data necessary to boot the machine</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a partition with configuration data and server programs</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>one or more partitions containing the server data such as database tables, user mails, an ftp archive etc.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>a partition with user programs and applications</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>one or more partitions for the user specific files (home directories)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>one or more swap partitions (virtual memory)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist> 

<para>Servers usually have more memory and thus more swap space.  Certain server processes, such as databases, may require more swap space than usual; see the specific documentation for detailed information.  For better performance, swap is often divided into different swap partitions.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_01_02_03"><title>Mount points</title>
<para>All partitions are attached to the system via a mount point.  The mount point defines the place of a particular data set in the file system.  Usually, all partitions are connected through the <emphasis>root</emphasis> partition.  On this partition, which is indicated with the slash (/), directories are created.  These empty directories will be the starting point of the partitions that are attached to them.  An example: given a partition that holds the following directories:</para>
<screen>
videos/		cd-images/	pictures/
</screen>
<para>We want to attach this partition in the filesystem in a directory called <filename>/opt/media</filename>.  In order to do this, the system administrator has to make sure that the directory <filename>/opt/media</filename> exists on the system.  Preferably, it should be an empty directory.  How this is done is explained lateron in this chapter.  Then, using the <command>mount</command> command, the administrator can attach the partition to the system.  When you look at the content of the formerly empty directory <filename>/opt/media</filename>, it will contain the files and directories that are on the mounted medium (hard disk oor partition of a hard disk, CD, DVD, flash card, USB or other storage device).</para>
<para>During system startup, all the partitions are thus mounted, as described in the file <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>.  Some partitions are not mounted by default, for instance if they are not constantly connected to the system, such like the storage used by your digital camera.  If well configured, the device will be mounted as soon as the system notices that it is connected, or it can be user-mountable, i.e. you don't need to be system administrator to attach and detach the device to and from the system.  There is an example in <xref linkend="sect_09_03"></xref>.</para>

<para>On a running system, information about the partitions and their mount points can be displayed using the <command>df</command> command (which stands for <emphasis>disk full</emphasis> or <emphasis>disk free</emphasis>).  In Linux, <command>df</command> is the GNU version, and supports the <option>-h</option> or <emphasis>human readable</emphasis> option which greatly improves readability.  Note that commercial UNIX machines commonly have their own versions of <command>df</command> and many other commands.  Their behavior is usually the same, though GNU versions of common tools often have more and better features.</para>
<para>The <command>df</command> command only displays information about active non-swap partitions.  These can include partitions from other networked systems, like in the example below where the home directories are mounted from a file server on the network, a situation often encountered in corporate environments.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_03_01_03"><title>More file system layout</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_01_03_01"><title>Visual</title>
<para>For convenience, the Linux file system is usually thought of in a tree structure.  On a standard Linux system you will find the layout generally follows the scheme presented below.</para>
<figure><title>Linux file system layout</title>

</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<para>This is a layout from a RedHat system.  Depending on the system admin, the operating system and the mission of the UNIX machine, the structure may vary, and directories may be left out or added at will.  The names are not even required; they are only a convention.</para>
<para>The tree of the file system starts at the trunk or <emphasis>slash</emphasis>, indicated by a forward slash (/).  This directory, containing all underlying directories and files, is also called the <emphasis>root directory</emphasis> or <quote>the root</quote> of the file system.</para>
<para>Directories that are only one level below the root directory are often preceded by a slash, to indicate their position and prevent confusion with other directories that could have the same name.  When starting with a new system, it is always a good idea to take a look in the root directory.  Let's see what you could run into:</para>

<sect3 id="sect_03_01_03_02"><title>The file system in reality</title>
<para>For most users and for most common system administration tasks, it is enough to accept that files and directories are ordered in a tree-like structure.  The computer, however, doesn't understand a thing about trees or tree-structures.</para> 
<para>Every partition has its own file system.  By imagining all those file systems together, we can form an idea of the tree-structure of the entire system, but it is not as simple as that.  In a file system, a file is represented by an <emphasis>inode</emphasis>, a kind of serial number containing information about the actual data that makes up the file: to whom this file belongs, and where is it located on the hard disk.</para>
<para>Every partition has its own set of inodes; throughout a system with multiple partitions, files with the same inode number can exist.</para>
<para>Each inode describes a data structure on the hard disk, storing the properties of a file, including the physical location of the file data.  When a hard disk is initialized to accept data storage, usually during the initial system installation process or when adding extra disks to an existing system, a fixed number of inodes per partition is created.  This number will be the maximum amount of files, of all types (including directories, special files, links etc.) that can exist at the same time on the partition.  We typically count on having 1 inode per 2 to 8 kilobytes of storage.</para>
<para>At the time a new file is created, it gets a free inode.  In that inode is the following information:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Owner and group owner of the file.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>File type (regular, directory, ...)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Permissions on the file <xref linkend="sect_03_04_01"></xref></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Date and time of creation, last read and change.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Date and time this information has been changed in the inode.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Number of links to this file (see later in this chapter).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>File size</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>An address defining the actual location of the file data.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The only information not included in an inode, is the file name and directory.  These are stored in the special directory files.  By comparing file names and inode numbers, the system can make up a tree-structure that the user understands.  Users can display inode numbers using the <option>-i</option> option to ls.  The inodes have their own separate space on the disk.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect_03_02"><title>Orientation in the file system</title>
<sect2 id="sect_03_02_01"><title>The path</title>
<para>When you want the system to execute a command, you almost never have to give the full path to that command.  For example, we know that the <command>ls</command> command is in the <filename>/bin</filename> directory (check with <command>which <option>-a</option> <parameter>ls</parameter></command>), yet we don't have to enter the command <command>/bin/ls</command> for the computer to list the content of the current directory.</para>
<para>The <varname>PATH</varname> environment variable takes care of this.  This variable lists those directories in the system where executable files can be found, and thus saves the user a lot of typing and memorizing locations of commands.  So the path naturally contains a lot of directories containing <filename>bin</filename> somewhere in their names, as the user below demonstrates.  The <command>echo</command> command is used to display the content (<quote>$</quote>) of the variable <varname>PATH</varname>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>rogier:&gt;</prompt> <command>echo $PATH</command>
/opt/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin/:/bin
</screen>
<para>In this example, the directories <filename>/opt/local/bin</filename>, <filename>/usr/X11R6/bin</filename>, <filename>/usr/bin</filename>, <filename>/usr/sbin</filename> and <filename>/bin</filename> are subsequently searched for the required program.  As soon as a match is found, the search is stopped, even if not every directory in the path has been searched.  This can lead to strange situations.  In the first example below, the user knows there is a program called <command>sendsms</command> to send an SMS message, and another user on the same system can use it, but she can't.  The difference is in the configuration of the <varname>PATH</varname> variable:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[jenny@blob jenny]$</prompt> <command>sendsms</command>
bash: sendsms: command not found
[jenny@blob jenny]$ echo $PATH
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/X11R6/bin:/home/jenny/bin
[jenny@blob jenny]$ su - tony

<para>Note the use of the <command>su</command> (switch user) facility, which allows you to run a shell in the environment of another user, on the condition that you know the user's password.</para>
<para>A backslash indicates the continuation of a line on the next, without an <keycap>Enter</keycap> separating one line from the other.</para>
<para>In the next example, a user wants to call on the <command>wc</command> (word count) command to check the number of lines in a file, but nothing happens and he has to break off his action using the <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>+<keycap>C</keycap> combination:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>jumper:~&gt;</prompt> <command>wc -l test</command>

(Ctrl-C)
<prompt>jumper:~&gt;</prompt> <command>which wc</command>
wc is hashed (/home/jumper/bin/wc)

<prompt>jumper:~&gt;</prompt> <command>echo $PATH</command>
/home/jumper/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:\
/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin
</screen>
<para>The use of the <command>which</command> command shows us that this user has a <filename>bin</filename>-directory in his home directory, containing a program that is also called <command>wc</command>.  Since the program in his home directory is found first when searching the paths upon a call for <command>wc</command>, this <quote>home-made</quote> program is executed, with input it probably doesn't understand, so we have to stop it.  To resolve this problem there are several ways (there are always several ways to solve a problem in UNIX/Linux): one answer could be to rename the user's <command>wc</command> program, or the user can give the full path to the exact command he wants, which can be found by using the <option>-a</option> to the <command>which</command> command:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>jumper:~&gt;</prompt> <command>/usr/bin/wc -l test</command>
       10 test
</screen>
<para>If the user uses programs in the other directories more frequently, he can change his path to look in his own directories last:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>jumper:~&gt;</prompt> <command>export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:\
/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/home/jumper/bin</command>
</screen>
<note><title>Changes are not permanent!</title>
<para>Note that when using the <command>export</command> command in a shell, the changes are temporary and only valid for this session (until you log out).  Opening new sessions, even while the current one is still running, will not result in a new path in the new session.  We will see in <xref linkend="sect_07_02"></xref> how we can make these kinds of changes to the environment permanent, adding these lines to the shell configuration files.</para></note>

<sect2 id="sect_03_02_02"><title>Absolute and relative paths</title>
<para>A path, which is the way you need to follow in the tree structure to reach a given file, can be described as starting from the trunk of the tree (the / or root directory).  In that case, the path starts with a slash and is called an absolute path, since there can be no mistake: only one file on the system can comply.</para>
<para>In the other case, the path doesn't start with a slash and confusion is possible between <filename>~/bin/wc</filename> (in the user's home directory) and <filename>bin/wc</filename> in <filename>/usr</filename>, from the previous example.  Paths that don't start with a slash are always relative.</para>
<para>In relative paths we also use the . and .. indications for the current and the parent directory.  A couple of practical examples:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>When you want to compile source code, the installation documentation often instructs you to run the command <command>./configure</command>, which runs the <emphasis>configure</emphasis> program located in the current directory (that came with the new code), as opposed to running another configure program elsewhere on the system.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>In HTML files, relative paths are often used to make a set of pages easily movable to another place:</para>

<sect3 id="sect_03_02_03_01"><title>The kernel</title>
<para>The kernel is the heart of the system.  It manages the communication between the underlying hardware and the peripherals.  The kernel also makes sure that processes and daemons (server processes) are started and stopped at the exact right times.  The kernel has a lot of other important tasks, so many that there is a special kernel-development mailing list on this subject only, where huge amounts of information are shared.  It would lead us too far to discuss the kernel in detail.  For now it suffices to know that the kernel is the most important file on the system.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_02_03_02"><title>The shell</title>
<sect4><title>What is a shell?</title>
<para>When I was looking for an appropriate explanation on the concept of a <emphasis>shell</emphasis>, it gave me more trouble than I expected.  All kinds of definitions are available, ranging from the simple comparison that <quote>the shell is the steering wheel of the car</quote>, to the vague definition in the Bash manual which says that <quote>bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter,</quote> or an even more obscure expression, <quote>a shell manages the interaction between the system and its users</quote>.  A shell is much more than that.</para>
<para>A shell can best be compared with a way of talking to the computer, a language.  Most users do know that other language, the point-and-click language of the desktop.  But in that language the computer is leading the conversation, while the user has the passive role of picking tasks from the ones presented.  It is very difficult for a programmer to include all options and possible uses of a command in the GUI-format.  Thus, GUIs are almost always less capable than the command or commands that form the backend.</para>
<para>The shell, on the other hand, is an advanced way of communicating with the system, because it allows for two-way conversation and taking initiative.  Both partners in the communication are equal, so new ideas can be tested.  The shell allows the user to handle a system in a very flexible way. An additional asset is that the shell allows for task automation.</para>
</sect4>
<sect4><title>Shell types</title>
<para>Just like people know different languages and dialects, the computer knows different shell types:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><command>sh</command> or Bourne Shell: the original shell still used on UNIX systems and in UNIX related environments.  This is the basic shell, a small program with few features.  When in POSIX-compatible mode, <command>bash</command> will emulate this shell.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>bash</command> or Bourne Again shell: the standard GNU shell, intuitive and flexible.  Probably most advisable for beginning users while being at the same time a powerful tool for the advanced and professional user.  On Linux, <command>bash</command> is the standard shell for common users.  This shell is a so-called <emphasis>superset</emphasis> of the Bourne shell, a set of add-ons and plug-ins.  This means that the Bourne Again shell is compatible with the Bourne shell: commands that work in <command>sh</command>, also work in <command>bash</command>.  However, the reverse is not always the case.  All examples and exercises in this book use <command>bash</command>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>csh</command> or C shell: the syntax of this shell resembles that of the C programming language.  Sometimes asked for by programmers.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>tcsh</command> or Turbo C shell: a superset of the common C shell, enhancing user-friendliness and speed.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>ksh</command> or the Korn shell: sometimes appreciated by people with a UNIX background.  A superset of the Bourne shell; with standard configuration a nightmare for beginning users.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>The file <filename>/etc/shells</filename> gives an overview of known shells on a Linux system:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>mia:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat /etc/shells</command>
/bin/bash
/bin/sh
/bin/tcsh
/bin/csh
</screen>
<note><title>Fake Bourne shell</title>
<para>Note that <filename>/bin/sh</filename> is usually a link to Bash, which will execute in Bourne shell compatible mode when called on this way.</para>
</note>
<para>Your default shell is set in the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file, like this line for user <emphasis>mia</emphasis>:</para>
<screen>
mia:L2NOfqdlPrHwE:504:504:Mia Maya:/home/mia:/bin/bash
</screen>
<para>To switch from one shell to another, just enter the name of the new shell in the active terminal.  The system finds the directory where the name occurs using the <varname>PATH</varname> settings, and since a shell is an executable file (program), the current shell activates it and it gets executed.  A new prompt is usually shown, because each shell has its typical appearance:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>mia:~&gt;</prompt> <command>tcsh</command>
<prompt>[mia@post21 ~]$</prompt>
</screen>
</sect4>
<sect4><title>Which shell am I using?</title>
<para>If you don't know which shell you are using, either check the line for your account in <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> or type the command</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>echo <varname>$SHELL</varname></command></cmdsynopsis>
</sect4>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_02_03_03"><title>Your home directory</title>

<para>Your home directory is your default destination when connecting to the system.  In most cases it is a subdirectory of <filename>/home</filename>, though this may vary.  Your home directory may be located on the hard disk of a remote file server; in that case your home directory may be found in <filename>/nethome/your_user_name</filename>.  In another case the system administrator may have opted for a less comprehensible layout and your home directory may be on <filename>/disk6/HU/07/jgillard</filename>.</para>
<para>Whatever the path to your home directory, you don't have to worry too much about it.  The correct path to your home directory is stored in the <varname>HOME</varname> environment variable, in case some program needs it.  With the <command>echo</command> command you can display the content of this variable:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>orlando:~&gt;</prompt> <command>echo $HOME</command>
/nethome/orlando
</screen>
<para>You can do whatever you like in your home directory.  You can put as many files in as many directories as you want, although the total amount of data and files is naturally limited because of the hardware and size of the partitions, and sometimes because the system administrator has applied a quota system.  Limiting disk usage was common practice when hard disk space was still expensive.  Nowadays, limits are almost exclusively applied in large environments.  You can see for yourself if a limit is set using the <command>quota</command> command:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>pierre@lamaison:/&gt;</prompt> <command>quota -v</command>
Diskquotas for user pierre (uid 501): none
</screen>
<para>In case quotas have been set, you get a list of the limited partitions and their specific limitations.  Exceeding the limits may be tolerated during a grace period with fewer or no restrictions at all.  Detailed information can be found using the <command>info <parameter>quota</parameter></command> or <command>man <parameter>quota</parameter></command> commands.</para>
<note><title>No Quota?</title>
<para>If your system can not find the <command>quota</command>, then no limitation of file system usage is being applied.</para>
</note>
<para>Your home directory is indicated by a tilde (~), shorthand for <filename>/path_to_home/user_name</filename>.  This same path is stored in the <varname>HOME</varname> variable, so you don't have to do anything to activate it.  A simple application: switch from <filename>/var/music/albums/arno/2001</filename> to <filename>images</filename> in your home directory using one elegant command:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>rom:/var/music/albums/arno/2001&gt;</prompt> <command>cd ~/images</command>

<prompt>rom:~/images&gt;</prompt> <command>pwd</command>
/home/rom/images
</screen>
<para>Later in this chapter we will talk about the commands for managing files and directories in order to keep your home directory tidy.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_03_02_04"><title>The most important configuration files</title>
<para>As we mentioned before, most configuration files are stored in the <filename>/etc</filename> directory.  Content can be viewed using the <command>cat</command> command, which sends text files to the standard output (usually your monitor).  The syntax is straight forward:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>cat <filename>file1</filename> <filename>file2</filename> ... <filename>fileN</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>In this section we try to give an overview of the most common configuration files.  This is certainly not a complete list.  Adding extra packages may also add extra configuration files in <filename>/etc</filename>.  When reading the configuration files, you will find that they are usually quite well commented and self-explanatory.  Some files also have man pages which contain extra documentation, such as <command>man <parameter>group</parameter></command>.</para>

<para>Devices, generally every peripheral attachment of a PC that is not the CPU itself, is presented to the system as an entry in the <filename>/dev</filename> directory.  One of the advantages of this UNIX-way of handling devices is that neither the user nor the system has to worry much about the specification of devices.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_03_02_06"><title>The most common variable files</title>

<para>In the <filename>/var</filename> directory we find a set of directories for storing specific non-constant data (as opposed to the ls program or the system configuration files, which change relatively infrequently or never at all).  All files that change frequently, such as log files, mailboxes, lock files, spoolers etc. are kept in a subdirectory of <filename>/var</filename>.</para>
<para>As a security measure these files are usually kept in separate parts from the main system files, so we can keep a close eye on them and set stricter permissions where necessary.  A lot of these files also need more permissions than usual, like <filename>/var/tmp</filename>, which needs to be writable for everyone.  A lot of user activity might be expected here, which might even be generated by anonymous Internet users connected to your system.  This is one reason why the <filename>/var</filename> directory, including all its subdirectories, is usually on a separate partition.  This way, there is for instance no risk that a mail bomb, for instance, fills up the rest of the file system, containing more important data such as your programs and configuration files.</para>
<note><title>/var/tmp and /tmp</title>
<para>Files in <filename>/tmp</filename> can be deleted without notice, by regular system tasks or because of a system reboot.  On some (customized) systems, also <filename>/var/tmp</filename> might behave unpredictably.  Nevertheless, since this is not the case by default, we advise to use the <filename>/var/tmp</filename> directory for saving temporary files.  When in doubt, check with your system administrator.  If you manage your own system, you can be reasonably sure that this is a safe place if you did not consciously change settings on <filename>/var/tmp</filename> (as root, a normal user can not do this).</para>
<para>Whatever you do, try to stick to the privileges granted to a normal user - don't go saving files directly under the root (/) of the file system, don't put them in <filename>/usr</filename> or some subdirectory or in another reserved place.  This pretty much limits your access to safe file systems.</para>
</note>
<para>One of the main security systems on a UNIX system, which is naturally implemented on every Linux machine as well, is the log-keeping facility, which logs all user actions, processes, system events etc.  The configuration file of the so-called <emphasis>syslogdaemon</emphasis> determines which and how long logged information will be kept.  The default location of all logs is <filename>/var/log</filename>, containing different files for access log, server logs, system messages etc.</para>
<para>In <filename>/var</filename> we typically find server data, which is kept here to separate it from critical data such as the server program itself and its configuration files.  A typical example on Linux systems is <filename>/var/www</filename>, which contains the actual HTML pages, scripts and images that a web server offers.  The FTP-tree of an FTP server (data that can be downloaded by a remote client) is also best kept in one of <filename>/var</filename>'s subdirectories.  Because this data is publicly accessible and often changeable by anonymous users, it is safer to keep it here, away from partitions or directories with sensitive data.</para>
<para>On most workstation installations, <filename>/var/spool</filename> will at least contain an <filename>at</filename> and a <filename>cron</filename> directory, containing scheduled tasks.  In office environments this directory usually contains <filename>lpd</filename> as well, which holds the print queue(s) and further printer configuration files, as well as the printer log files.</para>
<para>On server systems we will generally find <filename>/var/spool/mail</filename>, containing incoming mails for local users, sorted in one file per user, the user's <quote>inbox</quote>.  A related directory is <filename>mqueue</filename>, the spooler area for unsent mail messages.  These parts of the system can be very busy on mail servers with a lot of users.  News servers also use the <filename>/var/spool</filename> area because of the enormous amounts of messages they have to process.</para>
<para>The <filename>/var/lib/rpm</filename> directory is specific to RPM-based (RedHat Package Manager) distributions; it is where RPM package information is stored.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_03_03_01"><title>Viewing file properties</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_01_01"><title>More about ls</title>
<para>Besides the name of the file, <command>ls</command> can give a lot of other information, such as the file type, as we already discussed.  It can also show permissions on a file, file size, inode number, creation date and time, owners and amount of links to the file.  With the <option>-a</option> option to <command>ls</command>, files that are normally hidden from view can be displayed as well.  These are files that have a name starting with a dot.  A couple of typical examples include the configuration files in your home directory.  When you've worked with a certain system for a while, you will notice that tens of files and directories have been created that are not automatically listed in a directory index.  Next to that, every directory contains a file named just dot (.) and one with two dots (..), which are used in combination with their inode number to determine the directory's position in the file system's tree structure.</para>
<para>You should really read the Info pages about <command>ls</command>, since it is a very common command with a lot of useful options.  Options can be combined, as is the case with most UNIX commands and their options.  A common combination is <command>ls <option>-al</option></command>; it shows a long list of files and their properties as well as the destinations that any symbolic links point to.  <command>ls <option>-latr</option></command> displays the same files, only now in reversed order of the last change, so that the file changed most recently occurs at the bottom of the list.  Here are a couple of examples:</para>

<sect2 id="sect_03_03_02"><title>Creating and deleting files and directories</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_02_01"><title>Making a mess...</title>
<para>... Is not a difficult thing to do.  Today almost every system is networked, so naturally files get copied from one machine to another.  And especially when working in a graphical environment, creating new files is a piece of cake and is often done without the approval of the user.  To illustrate the problem, here's the full content of a new user's directory, created on a standard RedHat system:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[newuser@blob user]$</prompt> <command>ls -al</command>
total 32

<para>On first sight, the content of a <quote>used</quote> home directory doesn't look that bad either:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>olduser:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls</command>

</screen>
<para>But when all the directories and files starting with a dot are included, there are 185 items in this directory.  This is because most applications have their own directories and/or files, containing user-specific settings, in the home directory of that user.  Usually these files are created the first time you start an application.  In some cases you will be notified when a non-existent directory needs to be created, but most of the time everything is done automatically.</para>
<para>Furthermore, new files are created seemingly continuously because users want to save files, keep different versions of their work, use Internet applications, and download files and attachments to their local machine.  It doesn't stop.  It is clear that one definitely needs a scheme to keep an overview on things.</para>
<para>In the next section, we will discuss our means of keeping order.  We only discuss text tools available to the shell, since the graphical tools are very intuitive and have the same look and feel as the well known point-and-click MS Windows-style file managers, including graphical help functions and other features you expect from this kind of applications.  The following list is an overview of the most popular file managers for GNU/Linux.  Most file managers can be started from the menu of your desktop manager, or by clicking your home directory icon, or from the command line, issuing these commands:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><command>nautilus</command>: The default file manager in Gnome, the GNU desktop.  Excellent documentation about working with this tool can be found at <ulink url="http://www.gnome.org/learn/users-guide/latest/gosnautilus-1.html">http://www.gnome.org</ulink>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>konqueror</command>: The file manager typically used on a KDE desktop.  The handbook is at <ulink url="http://docs.kde.org/en/3.1/kdebase/konqueror/">http://docs.kde.org</ulink>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>mc</command>: Midnight Commander, the Unix file manager after the fashion of Norton Commander.  All documentation available from <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/directory/midnightcommander.html">http://gnu.org/directory/</ulink> or a mirror, such as <ulink url="http://www.ibiblio.org"></ulink>.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>These applications are certainly worth giving a try and usually impress newcomers to Linux, if only because there is such a wide variety: these are only the most popular tools for managing directories and files, and many other projects are being developed.  Now let's find out about the internals and see how these graphical tools use common UNIX commands.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_02_03"><title>The tools</title>
<sect4><title>Creating directories</title>
<para>A way of keeping things in place is to give certain files specific default locations by creating directories and subdirectories (or folders and sub-folders if you wish).  This is done with the <command>mkdir</command> command:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>richard:~&gt;</prompt> <command>mkdir archive</command>

<prompt>richard:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -ld archive</command>
drwxrwxrwx  2 richard richard           4096 Jan 13 14:09 archive/
</screen>
<para>Creating directories and subdirectories in one step is done using the <option>-p</option> option:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>richard:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cd archive</command>

<prompt>richard:~/archive&gt;</prompt> <command>mkdir 1999 2000 2001</command>

<prompt>richard:~/archive&gt;</prompt> <command>ls</command>
1999/  2000/  2001/

<prompt>richard:~/archive&gt;</prompt> <command>mkdir 2001/reports/Restaurants-Michelin/</command>
mkdir: cannot create directory `2001/reports/Restaurants-Michelin/':
No such file or directory

<prompt>richard:~/archive&gt;</prompt> <command>mkdir -p 2001/reports/Restaurants-Michelin/</command>

<prompt>richard:~/archive&gt;</prompt> <command>ls 2001/reports/</command>
Restaurants-Michelin/
</screen>
<para>If the new file needs other permissions than the default file creation permissions, the new access rights can be set in one move, still using the <command>mkdir</command> command, see the Info pages for more.  We are going to discuss access modes in the next section on File Security.</para>
<para>The name of a directory has to comply with the same rules as those applied on regular file names.  One of the most important restrictions is that you can't have two files with the same name in one directory (but keep in mind that Linux is, like UNIX, a case sensitive operating system).  There are virtually no limits on the length of a file name, but it is usually kept shorter than 80 characters, so it can fit on one line of a terminal.  You can use any character you want in a file name, although it is advised to exclude characters that have a special meaning to the shell.  When in doubt, check with <xref linkend="app3"></xref>.</para>
</sect4>
<sect4><title>Moving files</title>
<para>Now that we have properly structured our home directory, it is time to clean up unclassified files using the <command>mv</command> command:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>richard:~/archive&gt;</prompt> <command>mv ../report[1-4].doc reports/Restaurants-Michelin/</command>
</screen>
<para>This command is also applicable when renaming files:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>richard:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls To_Do</command>
-rw-rw-r--    1 richard richard      2534 Jan 15 12:39 To_Do

<prompt>richard:~&gt;</prompt> <command>mv To_Do done</command>

<prompt>richard:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l done</command>
-rw-rw-r--    1 richard richard      2534 Jan 15 12:39 done
</screen>
<para>It is clear that only the name of the file changes.  All other properties remain the same.</para>
<para>Detailed information about the syntax and features of the <command>mv</command> command can be found in the man or Info pages.  The use of this documentation should always be your first reflex when confronted with a problem.  The answer to your problem is likely to be in the system documentation.  Even experienced users read man pages every day, so beginning users should read them all the time.  After a while, you will get to know the most common options to the common commands, but you will still need the documentation as a primary source of information.  Note that the information contained in the HOWTOs, FAQs, man pages and such is slowly being merged into the Info pages, which are today the most up-to-date source of online (as in readily available on the system) documentation.</para>
</sect4>
<sect4><title>Copying files</title>
<para>Copying files and directories is done with the <command>cp</command> command.  A useful option is recursive copy (copy all underlying files and subdirectories), using the <option>-R</option> option to <command>cp</command>.  The general syntax is</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>cp <optional><option>-R</option></optional> <filename>fromfile</filename> <filename>tofile</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>As an example the case of user <emphasis>newguy</emphasis>, who wants the same Gnome desktop settings user <emphasis>oldguy</emphasis> has.  One way to solve the problem is to copy the settings of <emphasis>oldguy</emphasis> to the home directory of <emphasis>newguy</emphasis>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>victor:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cp -R ../oldguy/.gnome/ .</command>
</screen>
<para>This gives some errors involving file permissions, but all the errors have to do with private files that <emphasis>newguy</emphasis> doesn't need anyway.  We will discuss in the next part how to change these permissions in case they really are a problem.</para>

</sect4>
<sect4><title>Removing files</title>
<para>Use the <command>rm</command> command to remove single files, <command>rmdir</command> to remove empty directories.  (Use <command>ls <option>-a</option></command> to check whether a directory is empty or not).  The <command>rm</command> command also has options for removing non-empty directories with all their subdirectories, read the Info pages for these rather dangerous options.</para>
<note><title>How empty can a directory be?</title>
<para>It is normal that the directories . (dot) and .. (dot-dot) can't be removed, since they are also necessary in an empty directory to determine the directories ranking in the file system hierarchy.</para></note>
<para>On Linux, just like on UNIX, there is no garbage can - at least not for the shell, although there are plenty of solutions for graphical use.  So once removed, a file is really gone, and there is generally no way to get it back unless you have backups, or you are really fast and have a real good system administrator.  To protect the beginning user from this malice, the interactive behavior of the <command>rm</command>, <command>cp</command> and <command>mv</command> commands can be activated using the <option>-i</option> option.  In that case the system won't immediately act upon request.  Instead it will ask for confirmation, so it takes an additional click on the <keycap>Enter</keycap> key to inflict the damage:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>mary:~&gt;</prompt> <command>rm -ri archive/</command>
rm: descend into directory `archive'? <command>y</command>
rm: descend into directory `archive/reports'? <command>y</command>
rm: remove directory `archive/reports'? <command>y</command>
rm: descend into directory `archive/backup'? <command>y</command>
rm: remove `archive/backup/sysbup200112.tar'? <command>y</command>
rm: remove directory `archive/backup'? <command>y</command>
rm: remove directory `archive'? <command>y</command>
</screen>
<para>We will discuss how to make this option the default in <xref linkend="chap_07"></xref>, which discusses customizing your shell environment.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_03_03_03"><title>Finding files</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_03_01"><title>Using shell features</title>
<para>In the example on moving files we already saw how the shell can manipulate multiple files at once.  In that example, the shell finds out automatically what the user means by the requirements between the square braces <quote>[</quote> and <quote>]</quote>.  The shell can substitute ranges of numbers and upper or lower case characters alike.  It also substitutes as many characters as you want with an asterisk, and only one character with a question mark.</para>
<para>All sorts of substitutions can be used simultaneously; the shell is very logical about it.  The Bash shell, for instance, has no problem with expressions like <command>ls <parameter>dirname/*/*/*[2-3]</parameter></command>.</para>
<para>In other shells, the asterisk is commonly used to minimize the efforts of typing:  people would enter <command>cd <parameter>dir*</parameter></command> instead of <command>cd <filename>directory</filename></command>.  In Bash however, this is not necessary because the GNU shell has a feature called file name completion.  It means that you can type the first few characters of a command (anywhere) or a file (in the current directory) and if no confusion is possible, the shell will find out what you mean.   For example in a directory containing many files, you can check if there are any files beginning with the letter A just by typing <command>ls <parameter>A</parameter></command> and pressing the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key twice, rather than pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap>.  If there is only one file starting with <quote>A</quote>, this file will be shown as the argument to <command>ls</command> (or any shell command, for that matter) immediately.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_03_02"><title>Which</title>
<para>A very simple way of looking up files is using the <command>which</command> command, to look in the directories listed in the user's search path for the required file.  Of course, since the search path contains only paths to directories containing executable programs, <command>which</command> doesn't work for ordinary files.  The <command>which</command> command is useful when troubleshooting <quote>Command not Found</quote> problems.  In the example below, user <emphasis>tina</emphasis> can't use the <command>acroread</command> program, while her colleague has no troubles whatsoever on the same system.  The problem is similar to the PATH problem in the previous part: Tina's colleague tells her that he can see the required program in <filename>/opt/acroread/bin</filename>, but this directory is not in her path:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>tina:~&gt;</prompt> <command>which acroread</command>
/usr/bin/which: no acroread in (/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11)
</screen>
<para>The problem can be solved by giving the full path to the command to run, or by re-exporting the content of the <varname>PATH</varname> variable:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>tina:~&gt;</prompt> <command>export PATH=$PATH:/opt/acroread/bin</command>

<prompt>tina:~&gt;</prompt> <command>echo $PATH</command>
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/opt/acroread/bin
</screen>
<para>Using the <command>which</command> command also checks to see if a command is an alias for another command:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>gerrit:~&gt;</prompt> <command>which -a ls</command>
ls is aliased to `ls -F --color=auto'
ls is /bin/ls
</screen>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_03_03"><title>Find and locate</title>
<para>These are the real tools, used when searching other paths beside those listed in the search path.  The <command>find</command> tool, known from UNIX, is very powerful, which may be the cause of a somewhat more difficult syntax.  GNU <command>find</command>, however, deals with the syntax problems.  This command not only allows you to search file names, it can also accept file size, date of last change and other file properties as criteria for a search.  The most common use is for finding file names:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>find <filename>&lt;path&gt;</filename> <option>-name</option> <parameter>&lt;searchstring&gt;</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>This can be interpreted as <quote>Look in all files and subdirectories contained in a given path, and print the names of the files containing the search string in their name</quote> (not in their content).</para>
<para>Another application of <command>find</command> is for searching files of a certain size, as in the example below, where user <emphasis>peter</emphasis> wants to find all files in the current directory or one of its subdirectories, that are bigger than 5 MB:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>peter:~&gt;</prompt> <command>find . -size +5000k</command>
psychotic_chaos.mp3
</screen>
<para>If you dig in the man pages, you will see that <command>find</command> can also perform operations on the found files.  A common example is removing files.  It is best to first test without the <option>-exec</option> option that the correct files are selected, after that the command can be rerun to delete the selected files.  Below, we search for files ending in <filename>.tmp</filename>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>peter:~&gt; </prompt> <command>find . -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \;</command>

<prompt>peter:~&gt;</prompt>
</screen>
<tip><title>Optimize!</title>
<para>This command will call on <command>rm</command> as many times as a file answering the requirements is found.  In the worst case, this might be thousands or millions of times.  This is quite a load on your system.</para>
<para>A more realistic way of working would be the use of a pipe (|) and the <command>xargs</command> tool with <command>rm</command> as an argument.  This way, the <command>rm</command> command is only called when the command line is full, instead of for every file.  See <xref linkend="chap_05"></xref> for more on using I/O redirection to ease everyday tasks.</para>
</tip>
<para>Later on (in 1999 according to the man pages, after 20 years of <command>find</command>), <command>locate</command> was developed.  This program is easier to use, but more restricted than <command>find</command>, since its output is based on a file index database that is updated only once every day.  On the other hand, a search in the <command>locate</command> database uses less resources than <command>find</command> and therefore shows the results nearly instantly.</para>
<para>Most Linux distributions use <command>slocate</command> these days, security enhanced locate, the modern version of <command>locate</command> that prevents users from getting output they have no right to read.  The files in <emphasis>root</emphasis>'s home directory are such an example, these are not normally accessible to the public.  A user who wants to find someone who knows about the C-shell may issue the command <command>locate <filename>.cshrc</filename></command>, to display all users who have a customized configuration file for the C shell.  Supposing the users <emphasis>root</emphasis> and <emphasis>jenny</emphasis> are running C shell, then only the file <filename>/home/jenny/.cshrc</filename> will be displayed, and not the one in <emphasis>root</emphasis>'s home directory.  On most systems, <command>locate</command> is a symbolic link to the <command>slocate</command> program:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>billy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l /usr/bin/locate</command>
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root slocate  7 Oct 28 14:18 /usr/bin/locate -&gt; slocate*
</screen>
<para>User <emphasis>tina</emphasis> could have used <command>locate</command> to find the application she wanted:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>tina:~&gt;</prompt> <command>locate acroread</command>
/usr/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps/acroread.png

/usr/local/bin/acroread
/usr/local/Acrobat4/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread
/usr/local/Acrobat4/bin/acroread
</screen>
<para>Directories that don't contain the name <filename>bin</filename> can't contain the program - they don't contain executable files.  There are three possibilities left.  The file in <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> is the one <emphasis>tina</emphasis> would have wanted: it is a link to the shell script that starts the actual program:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>tina:~&gt;</prompt> <command>file /usr/local/bin/acroread</command>
/usr/local/bin/acroread: symbolic link to ../Acrobat4/bin/acroread

<prompt>tina:~&gt;</prompt> <command>file /usr/local/Acrobat4/bin/acroread</command>
/usr/local/Acrobat4/bin/acroread: Bourne shell script text executable

<prompt>tina:~&gt;</prompt> <command>file /usr/local/Acrobat4/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread</command>
/usr/local/Acrobat4/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread: ELF 32-bit LSB 
executable, Intel 80386, version 1, dynamically linked (uses 
shared libs), not stripped
</screen>
<para>In order to keep the path as short as possible, so the system doesn't have to search too long every time a user wants to execute a command, we add <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> to the path and not the other directories, which only contain the binary files of one specific program, while <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> contains other useful programs as well.</para>
<para>Again, a description of the full features of <command>find</command> and <command>locate</command> can be found in the Info pages.</para>

<sect4 id="sect_03_03_03_04_01"><title>General line filtering</title>
<para>A simple but powerful program, <command>grep</command> is used for filtering input lines and returning certain patterns to the output.  There are literally thousands of applications for the <command>grep</command> program.  In the example below, <emphasis>jerry</emphasis> uses <command>grep</command> to see how he did the thing with <command>find</command>:</para>

<para>Also useful in these cases is the search function in <command>bash</command>, activated by pressing <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>+<keycap>R</keycap> at once, such as in the example where we want to check how we did that last <command>find</command> again:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>thomas ~&gt;</prompt> <command>^R</command> 
(reverse-i-search)`find': find `/home/thomas` -name *.xml
</screen>
<para>Type your search string at the search prompt.  The more characters you type, the more restricted the search gets.  This reads the command history for this shell session (which is written to <filename>.bash_history</filename> in your home directory when you quit that session).  The most recent occurrence of your search string is shown.  If you want to see previous commands containing the same string, type <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>+<keycap>R</keycap> again.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_03_03_04_01"><title>General</title>
<para>Apart from <command>cat</command>, which really doesn't do much more than sending files to the standard output, there are other tools to view file content.</para>
<para>The easiest way of course would be to use graphical tools instead of command line tools.  In the introduction we already saw a glimpse of an office application, OpenOffice.  Other examples are the GIMP (start up with <command>gimp</command> from the command line), the GNU Image Manipulation Program; <command>xpdf</command> to view Portable Document Format files (PDF); GhostView (<command>gv</command>) for viewing PostScript files; Mozilla/FireFox, <command>links</command> (a text mode browser), Konqueror, Opera and many others for web content; XMMS, CDplay and others for multimedia file content; AbiWord, Gnumeric, KOffice etc. for all kinds of office applications and so on.  There are thousands of Linux applications; to list them all would take days.</para>
<para>Instead we keep concentrating on shell- or text-mode applications, which form the basics for all other applications.  These commands work best in a text environment on files containing text.  When in doubt, check first using the <command>file</command> command.</para>
<para>So let's see what text tools we have that are useful to look inside files.</para>
<note><title>Font problems</title>
<para>Plain text tools such as the ones we will now be discussing, often have problems with <quote>plain</quote> text files because of the font encoding used in those files.  Special characters, such as accented alphabetical characters, Chinese characters and other characters from languages using different character sets than the default <emphasis>en_US</emphasis> encoding and so on, are then displayed the wrong way or replaced by unreadable rubbish.  These problems are discussed in <xref linkend="sect_07_05"></xref>.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_03_03_04_02"><title><quote><command>less</command> is <command>more</command></quote></title>
<para>Undoubtedly you will hear someone say this phrase sooner or later when working in a UNIX environment.  A little bit of UNIX history explains this:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>First there was <command>cat</command>.  Output was streamed in an uncontrollable way.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Then there was <command>pg</command>, which may still be found on older UNIXes.  This command puts text to the output one page at the time.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The <command>more</command> program was a revised version of <command>pg</command>.  This command is still available on every Linux system.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>less</command> is the GNU version of more and has extra features allowing highlighting of search strings, scrolling back etc.  The syntax is very simple:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>less <filename>file</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>More information is located in the Info pages.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_03_03_05"><title>Linking files</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_05_01"><title>Link types</title>
<para>Since we know more about files and their representation in the file system, understanding links (or shortcuts) is a piece of cake.  A link is nothing more than a way of matching two or more file names to the same set of file data.  There are two ways to achieve this:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Hard link: Associate two or more file names with the same inode.  Hard links share the same data blocks on the hard disk, while they continue to behave as independent files.</para>
<para>There is an immediate disadvantage: hard links can't span partitions, because inode numbers are only unique within a given partition.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Soft link or symbolic link (or for short: symlink): a small file that is a pointer to another file.  A symbolic link contains the path to the target file instead of a physical location on the hard disk.  Since inodes are not used in this system, soft links can span across partitions.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The two link types behave similar, but are not the same, as illustrated in the scheme below:</para>
<figure><title>Hard and soft link mechanism</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/links.eps" format="EPS"></imagedata>
</imageobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="images/links.png" format="PNG"></imagedata>
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>Hard links share the same inode, symbolic links have their own inode that points to datablocks holding the filename of the original file that the link is pointing to.</phrase>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<para>Note that removing the target file for a symbolic link makes the link useless.</para>
<para>Each regular file is in principle a hardlink.  Hardlinks can not span across partitions, since they refer to inodes, and inode numbers are only unique within a given partition.</para>
<para>It may be argued that there is a third kind of link, the <emphasis>user-space</emphasis> link, which is similar to a shortcut in MS Windows.  These are files containing meta-data which can only be interpreted by the graphical file manager.  To the kernel and the shell these are just normal files.  They may end in a <emphasis>.desktop</emphasis> or <emphasis>.lnk</emphasis> suffix; an example can be found in <filename>~/.gnome-desktop</filename>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[dupont@boulot .gnome-desktop]$</prompt> <command>cat La\ Maison\ Dupont</command>
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=Legacy-Mixed
Name=La Maison Dupont
Type=X-nautilus-home
X-Nautilus-Icon=temp-home
URL=file:///home/dupont
</screen>
<para>This example is from a KDE desktop:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[lena@venus Desktop]$</prompt> <command>cat camera</command>
[Desktop Entry]
Dev=/dev/sda1
FSType=auto
Icon=memory
MountPoint=/mnt/camera
Type=FSDevice
X-KDE-Dynamic-Device=true
</screen>
<para>Creating this kind of link is easy enough using the features of your graphical environment.  Should you need help, your system documentation should be your first resort.</para>
<para>In the next section, we will study the creation of UNIX-style symbolic links using the command line.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_03_05_02"><title>Creating symbolic links</title>
<para>The symbolic link is particularly interesting for beginning users: they are fairly obvious to see and you don't need to worry about partitions.</para>
<para>The command to make links is <command>ln</command>.  In order to create symlinks, you need to use the <option>-s</option> option:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>ln <option>-s</option> <filename>targetfile</filename> <filename>linkname</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>In the example below, user <emphasis>freddy</emphasis> creates a link in a subdirectory of his home directory to a directory on another part of the system:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>freddy:~/music&gt;</prompt> <command>ln -s /opt/mp3/Queen/ Queen</command>

<prompt>freddy:~/music&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l</command>
lrwxrwxrwx  1 freddy  freddy  17 Jan 22 11:07 Queen -&gt; /opt/mp3/Queen
</screen>
<para>Symbolic links are always very small files, while hard links have the same size as the original file.</para>
<para>The application of symbolic links is widespread.  They are often used to save disk space, to make a copy of a file in order to satisfy installation requirements of a new program that expects the file to be in another location, they are used to fix scripts that suddenly have to run in a new environment and can generally save a lot of work.  A system admin may decide to move the home directories of the users to a new location, <filename>disk2</filename> for instance, but if he wants everything to work like before, like the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file, with a minimum of effort he will create a symlink from <filename>/home</filename> to the new location <filename>/disk2/home</filename>.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_03_04"><title>File security</title>
<sect2 id="sect_03_04_01"><title>Access rights: Linux's first line of defense</title>
<para>The Linux security model is based on the one used on UNIX systems, and is as rigid as the UNIX security model (and sometimes even more), which is already quite robust.  On a Linux system, every file is owned by a user and a group user.  There is also a third category of users, those that are not the user owner and don't belong to the group owning the file.  For each category of users, read, write and execute permissions can be granted or denied.</para>
<para>We already used the <emphasis>long</emphasis> option to list files using the <command>ls <option>-l</option></command> command, though for other reasons.  This command also displays file permissions for these three user categories; they are indicated by the nine characters that follow the first character, which is the file type indicator at the beginning of the file properties line.  As seen in the examples below, the first three characters in this series of nine display access rights for the actual user that owns the file.  The next three are for the group owner of the file, the last three for other users.  The permissions are always in the same order: read, write, execute for the user, the group and the others.  Some examples:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>marise:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l To_Do</command>
-rw-rw-r--    1 marise  users      5 Jan 15 12:39 To_Do
<prompt>marise:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l /bin/ls</command>
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root    root   45948 Aug  9 15:01 /bin/ls*
</screen>
<para>The first file is a regular file (first dash).  Users with user name <emphasis>marise</emphasis> or users belonging to the group <emphasis>users</emphasis> can read and write (change/move/delete) the file, but they can't execute it (second and third dash).  All other users are only allowed to read this file, but they can't write or execute it (fourth and fifth dash).</para>
<para>The second example is an executable file, the difference: everybody can run this program, but you need to be <emphasis>root</emphasis> to change it.</para>
<para>The Info pages explain how the <command>ls</command> command handles display of access rights in detail, see the section <emphasis>What information is listed</emphasis>.</para>
<para>For easy use with commands, both access rights or modes and user groups have a code.  See the tables below.</para>

<para>This straight forward scheme is applied very strictly, which allows a high level of security even without network security.  Among other functions, the security scheme takes care of user access to programs, it can serve files on a need-to-know basis and protect sensitive data such as home directories and system configuration files.</para>
<para>You should know what your user name is.  If you don't, it can be displayed using the <command>id</command> command, which also displays the default group you belong to and eventually other groups of which you are a member:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>tilly:~&gt;</prompt> <command>id</command>
uid=504(tilly) gid=504(tilly) groups=504(tilly),100(users),2051(org)
</screen>
<para>Your user name is also stored in the environment variable <varname>USER</varname>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>tilly:~&gt;</prompt> <command>echo $USER</command>

<sect2 id="sect_03_04_02"><title>The tools</title>
<sect3 id="sect_03_04_02_01"><title>The chmod command</title>
<para>A normal consequence of applying strict file permissions, and sometimes a nuisance, is that access rights will need to be changed for all kinds of reasons.  We use the <command>chmod</command> command to do this, and eventually <emphasis>to chmod</emphasis> has become an almost acceptable English verb, meaning the changing of the access mode of a file.  The <command>chmod</command> command can be used with alphanumeric or numeric options, whatever you like best.</para>
<para>The example below uses alphanumeric options  in order to solve a problem that commonly occurs with new users:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>asim:~&gt;</prompt> <command>./hello</command>
bash: ./hello: bad interpreter: Permission denied

<prompt>asim:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat hello</command>
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World"

<prompt>asim:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l hello</command>
-rw-rw-r--    1 asim    asim    32 Jan 15 16:29 hello

<prompt>asim:~&gt;</prompt> <command>chmod u+x hello</command>

<prompt>asim:~&gt;</prompt> <command>./hello</command>
Hello, World

<prompt>asim:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l hello</command>
-rwxrw-r--   1 asim    asim    32 Jan 15 16:29 hello*
</screen>
<para>The + and - operators are used to grant or deny a given right to a given group.  Combinations separated by commas are allowed.  The Info and man pages contain useful examples.  Here's another one, which makes the file from the previous example a private file to user <emphasis>asim</emphasis>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>asim:~&gt;</prompt> <command>chmod u+rwx,go-rwx hello</command>

<prompt>asim:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l hello</command>
-rwx------    1 asim    asim    32 Jan 15 16:29 hello*
</screen>
<para>The kind of problem resulting in an error message saying that permission is denied somewhere is usually a problem with access rights in most cases.  Also, comments like, <quote>It worked yesterday,</quote> and <quote>When I run this as root it works,</quote> are most likely caused by the wrong file permissions.</para>
<para>When using <command>chmod</command> with numeric arguments, the values for each granted access right have to be counted together per group.  Thus we get a 3-digit number, which is the symbolic value for the settings <command>chmod</command> has to make.  The following table lists the most common combinations:</para>

<para>If you enter a number with less than three digits as an argument to <command>chmod</command>, omitted characters are replaced with zeros starting from the left.  There is actually a fourth digit on Linux systems, that precedes the first three and sets special access modes.  Everything about these and many more are located in the Info pages.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_04_02_02"><title>Logging on to another group</title>
<para>When you type <command>id</command> on the command line, you get a list of all the groups that you can possibly belong to, preceded by your user name and ID and the group name and ID that you are currently connected with.  However, on many Linux systems you can only be actively logged in to one group at the time.  By default, this active or <emphasis>primary group</emphasis> is the one that you get assigned from the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file.  The fourth field of this file holds users' primary group ID, which is looked up in the <filename>/etc/group</filename> file.  An example:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>asim:~&gt;</prompt> <command>id</command>
uid=501(asim) gid=501(asim) groups=100(users),501(asim),3400(web)

<prompt>asim:~&gt;</prompt> <command>grep <parameter>asim</parameter> <filename>/etc/passwd</filename></command>
asim:x:501:501:Asim El Baraka:/home/asim:/bin/bash

<prompt>asim:~&gt;</prompt> <command>grep <parameter>501</parameter> <filename>/etc/group</filename></command>
asim:x:501:
</screen>
<para>The fourth field in the line from <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> contains the value <quote>501</quote>, which represents the group <emphasis>asim</emphasis> in the above example.  From <filename>/etc/group</filename> we can get the name matching this group ID.  When initially connecting to the system, this is the group that <emphasis>asim</emphasis> will belong to.</para>
<note><title>User private group scheme</title>
<para>In order to allow more flexibility, most Linux systems follow the so-called <emphasis>user private group scheme</emphasis>, that assigns each user primarily to his or her own group.  This group is a group that only contains this particular user, hence the name <quote>private group</quote>.  Usually this group has the same name as the user login name, which can be a bit confusing.</para> 
</note>
<para>Apart from his own private group, user <emphasis>asim</emphasis> can also be in the groups <emphasis>users</emphasis> and <emphasis>web</emphasis>.  Because these are secondary groups to this user, he will need to use the <command>newgrp</command> to log into any of these groups.  In the example, <emphasis>asim</emphasis> needs to create files that are owned by the group <emphasis>web</emphasis>.</para>
<screen>
<prompt>asim:/var/www/html&gt;</prompt> <command>newgrp <parameter>web</parameter></command>

<prompt>asim:/var/www/html&gt;</prompt> <command>id</command>
uid=501(asim) gid=3400(web) groups=100(users),501(asim),3400(web)
</screen>
<para>When <emphasis>asim</emphasis> creates new files now, they will be in group ownership of the group <emphasis>web</emphasis> instead of being owned by the group <emphasis>asim</emphasis>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>asim:/var/www/html&gt;</prompt> <command>touch <filename>test</filename></command>

<prompt>asim:/var/www/html&gt;</prompt> <command>ls <option>-l</option> <filename>test</filename></command>
-rw-rw-r--  1 asim web   0 Jun 10 15:38 test
</screen>
<para>Logging in to a new group prevents you from having to use <command>chown</command> (see <xref linkend="sect_03_04_02_04"></xref>) or calling your system administrator to change ownerships for you.</para>
<para>See the manpage for <command>newgrp</command> for more information.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_04_02_03"><title>The file mask</title>
<para>When a new file is saved somewhere, it is first subjected to the standard security procedure.  Files without permissions don't exist on Linux.  The standard file permission is determined by the <emphasis>mask</emphasis> for new file creation.  The value of this mask can be displayed using the <command>umask</command> command:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>bert:~&gt;</prompt> <command>umask</command>
0002
</screen>
<para>Instead of adding the symbolic values to each other, as with <command>chmod</command>, for calculating the permission on a new file they need to be subtracted from the total possible access rights.  In the example above, however, we see 4 values displayed, yet there are only 3 permission categories: <emphasis>user</emphasis>, <emphasis>group</emphasis> and <emphasis>other</emphasis>.  The first zero is part of the special file attributes settings, which we will discuss in <xref linkend="sect_03_04_02_04"></xref> and <xref linkend="sect_04_01_06"></xref>.  It might just as well be that this first zero is not displayed on your system when entering the <command>umask</command> command, and that you only see 3 numbers representing the default file creation mask.</para>
<para>Each UNIX-like system has a system function for creating new files, which is called each time a user uses a program that creates new files, for instance, when downloading a file from the Internet, when saving a new text document and so on.  This function creates both new files and new directories.  Full read, write and execute permission is granted to everybody when creating a new directory.  When creating a new file, this function will grant read and write permissions for everybody, but set execute permissions to none for all user categories.  This, before the mask is applied, a directory has permissions <emphasis>777</emphasis> or <emphasis>rwxrwxrwx</emphasis>, a plain file <emphasis>666</emphasis> or <emphasis>rw-rw-rw-</emphasis>.</para>
<para>The <emphasis>umask</emphasis> value is subtracted from these default permissions after the function has created the new file or directory.  Thus, a directory will have permissions of <emphasis>775</emphasis> by default, a file <emphasis>664</emphasis>, if the mask value is <emphasis>(0)002</emphasis>.  This is demonstrated in the example below:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>bert:~&gt;</prompt> <command>mkdir newdir</command>

<prompt>bert:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -ld newdir</command>
drwxrwxr-x    2 bert    bert		4096 Feb 28 13:45 newdir/

<prompt>bert:~&gt;</prompt> <command>touch newfile</command>

<prompt>bert:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l newfile</command>
-rw-rw-r--    1 bert    bert		   0 Feb 28 13:52 newfile
</screen>
<para>If you log in to another group using the <command>newgrp</command> command, the mask remains unchanged.  Thus, if it is set to <emphasis>002</emphasis>, files and directories that you create while being in the new group will also be accessible to the other members of that group; you don't have to use <command>chmod</command>.</para>
<para>The <emphasis>root</emphasis> user usually has stricter default file creation permissions:</para>
<screen>
[root@estoban root]# umask
022
</screen>
<para>These defaults are set system-wide in the shell resource configuration files, for instance <filename>/etc/bashrc</filename> or <filename>/etc/profile</filename>.  You can change them in your own shell configuration file, see <xref linkend="chap_07"></xref> on customizing your shell environment.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_03_04_02_04"><title>Changing user and group ownership</title>
<para>When a file is owned by the wrong user or group, the error can be repaired with the <command>chown</command> (change owner) and <command>chgrp</command> (change group) commands.  Changing file ownership is a frequent system administrative task in environments where files need to be shared in a group.  Both commands are very flexible, as you can find out by using the <option>--help</option> option.</para>
<para>The <command>chown</command> command can be applied to change both user and group ownership of a file, while <command>chgrp</command> only changes group ownership.  Of course the system will check if the user issuing one of these commands has sufficient permissions on the file(s) she wants to change.</para>
<para>In order to only change the user ownership of a file, use this syntax:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>chown <parameter>newuser</parameter> <filename>file</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>If you use a colon after the user name (see the Info pages), group ownership will be changed as well, to the primary group of the user issuing the command.  On a Linux system, each user has his own group, so this form can be used to make files private:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>jacky:~&gt;</prompt> <command>id</command>
uid=1304(jacky) gid=(1304) groups=1304(jacky),2034(pproject)

<prompt>jacky:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l my_report</command>
-rw-rw-r--  1 jacky   project       29387 Jan 15 09:34 my_report

<prompt>jacky:~&gt;</prompt> <command>chown jacky: my_report</command>

<prompt>jacky:~&gt;</prompt> <command>chmod o-r my_report</command>

<prompt>jacky:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l my_report</command>
-rw-rw----  1 jacky   jacky         29387 Jan 15 09:34 my_report
</screen>
<para>If <emphasis>jacky</emphasis> would like to share this file, without having to give everybody permission to write it, he can use the <command>chgrp</command> command:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>jacky:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l report-20020115.xls</command>
-rw-rw---- 1 jacky   jacky   45635 Jan 15 09:35 report-20020115.xls

<prompt>jacky:~&gt;</prompt> <command>chgrp project report-20020115.xls</command>

<prompt>jacky:~&gt;</prompt> <command>chmod o= report-20020115.xls</command>

<prompt>jacky:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l report-20020115.xls</command>
-rw-rw---- 1 jacky   project 45635 Jan 15 09:35 report-20020115.xls
</screen>
<para>This way, users in the group <emphasis>project</emphasis> will be able to work on this file.  Users not in this group have no business with it at all.</para>
<para>Both <command>chown</command> and <command>chgrp</command> can be used to change ownership recursively, using the <option>-R</option> option.  In that case, all underlying files and subdirectories of a given directory will belong to the given user and/or group.</para>
<note><title>Restrictions</title>
<para>On most systems, the use of the <command>chown</command> and <command>chgrp</command> commands is restricted for non-privileged users.  If you are not the administrator of the system, you can not change user nor group ownerships for security reasons.  If the usage of these commands would not be restricted, malicious users could assign ownership of files to other users and/or groups and change behavior of those users' environments and even cause damage to other users' files.</para>
</note>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="sect_03_04_02_05"><title>Special modes</title>
<para>For the system admin to not be bothered solving permission problems all the time, special access rights can be given to entire directories, or to separate programs.  There are three special modes:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Sticky bit mode: After execution of a job, the command is kept in the system memory.  Originally this was a feature used a lot to save memory: big jobs are loaded into memory only once.  But these days memory is inexpensive and there are better techniques to manage it, so it is not used anymore for its optimizing capabilities on single files.  When applied to an entire directory, however, the sticky bit has a different meaning.  In that case, a user can only change files in this directory when she is the user owner of the file or when the file has appropriate permissions.  This feature is used on directories like <filename>/var/tmp</filename>, that have to be accessible for everyone, but where it is not appropriate for users to change or delete each other's data.  The sticky bit is indicated by a <emphasis>t</emphasis> at the end of the file permission field:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>mark:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -ld /var/tmp</command>
drwxrwxrwt   19 root     root         8192 Jan 16 10:37 /var/tmp/
</screen>
<para>The sticky bit is set using the command <command>chmod <parameter>o+t</parameter> <filename>directory</filename></command>.  The historic origin of the <quote>t</quote> is in UNIX' <emphasis>save Text access</emphasis> feature.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>SUID (set user ID) and SGID (set group ID): represented by the character <emphasis>s</emphasis> in the user or group permission field.  When this mode is set on an executable file, it will run with the user and group permissions on the file instead of with those of the user issuing the command, thus giving access to system resources.  We will discuss this further in <xref linkend="chap_04"></xref>.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>SGID (set group ID) on a directory: in this special case every file created in the directory will have the same group owner as the directory itself (while normal behavior would be that new files are owned by the users who create them).  This way, users don't need to worry about file ownership when sharing directories:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>mimi:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -ld /opt/docs</command>
drwxrws---  4 root    users          4096 Jul 25 2001 docs/

-rw-rw----  1 mimi    users        345672 Aug 30 2001-Council.doc
</screen>
<para>This is the standard way of sharing files in UNIX.</para>
<note><title>Existing files are left unchanged!</title><para>Files that are being moved to a SGID directory but were created elsewhere keep their original user and group owner.  This may be confusing.</para></note>

<sect1 id="sect_03_05"><title>Summary</title>
<para>On UNIX, as on Linux, all entities are in some way or another presented to the system as files with the appropriate file properties.  Use of (predefined) paths allows the users and the system admin to find, read and manipulate files.</para>
<para>We've made our first steps toward becoming an expert: we discussed the real and the fake structure of the file system, and we know about the Linux file security model, as well as several other security precautions that are taken on every system by default.</para>
<para>The shell is the most important tool for interaction with the system.  We learned several shell commands in this chapter, which are listed in the table below.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_04_01"><title>Processes inside out</title>
<sect2 id="sect_04_01_01"><title>Multi-user and multi-tasking</title>
<para>Now that we are more used to our environment and we are able to communicate a little bit with our system, it is time to study the processes we can start in more detail.  Not every command starts a single process.  Some commands initiate a series of processes, such as <command>mozilla</command>; others, like <command>ls</command>, are executed as a single command.</para>
<para>Furthermore, Linux is based on UNIX, where it has been common policy to have multiple users running multiple commands, at the same time and on the same system.  It is obvious that measures have to be taken to have the CPU manage all these processes, and that functionality has to be provided so users can switch between processes.  In some cases, processes will have to continue to run even when the user who started them logs out.  And users need a means to reactivate interrupted processes.</para>
<para>We will explain the structure of Linux processes in the next sections.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_04_01_02"><title>Process types</title>
<sect3 id="sect_04_01_02_01"><title>Interactive processes</title>
<para>Interactive processes are initialized and controlled through a terminal session.  In other words, there has to be someone connected to the system to start these processes; they are not started automatically as part of the system functions.  These processes can run in the foreground, occupying the terminal that started the program, and you can't start other applications as long as this process is running in the foreground.  Alternatively, they can run in the background, so that the terminal in which you started the program can accept new commands while the program is running.  Until now, we mainly focussed on programs running in the foreground - the length of time taken to run them was too short to notice - but viewing a file with the <command>less</command> command is a good example of a command occupying the terminal session.  In this case, the activated program is waiting for you to do something.  The program is still connected to the terminal from where it was started, and the terminal is only useful for entering commands this program can understand.  Other commands will just result in errors or unresponsiveness of the system.</para>
<para>While a process runs in the background, however, the user is not prevented from doing other things in the terminal in which he started the program, while it is running.</para>
<para>The shell offers a feature called <emphasis>job control</emphasis> which allows easy handling of multiple processes.  This mechanism switches processes between the foreground and the background.  Using this system, programs can also be started in the background immediately.</para>
<para>Running a process in the background is only useful for programs that don't need user input (via the shell).  Putting a job in the background is typically done when execution of a job is expected to take a long time.  In order to free the issuing terminal after entering the command, a trailing ampersand is added.  In the example, using graphical mode, we open an extra terminal window from the existing one:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>billy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>xterm &amp;</command>
[1] 26558

<prompt>billy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>jobs</command>
[1]+  Running                 xterm &amp;
</screen>
<para>The full job control features are explained in detail in the <command>bash</command> Info pages, so only the frequently used job control applications are listed here:</para>

<para>More practical examples can be found in the exercises.</para>
<para>Most UNIX systems are likely to be able to run <command>screen</command>, which is useful when you actually want another shell to execute commands.  Upon calling <command>screen</command>, a new session is created with an accompanying shell and/or commands as specified, which you can then put out of the way.  In this new session you may do whatever it is you want to do.  All programs and operations will run independent of the issuing shell.  You can then detach this session, while the programs you started in it continue to run, even when you log out of the originating shell, and pick your <emphasis>screen</emphasis> up again any time you like.</para>
<para>This program originates from a time when virtual consoles were not invented yet, and everything needed to be done using one text terminal.  To addicts, it still has meaning in Linux, even though we've had virtual consoles for almost ten years.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_04_01_02_02"><title>Automatic processes</title>
<para>Automatic or batch processes are not connected to a terminal.  Rather, these are tasks that can be queued into a spooler area, where they wait to be executed on a FIFO (first-in, first-out) basis.  Such tasks can be executed using one of two criteria:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>At a certain date and time: done using the <command>at</command> command, which we will discuss in the second part of this chapter.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>At times when the total system load is low enough to accept extra jobs: done using the <command>batch</command> command.  By default, tasks are put in a queue where they wait to be executed until the system load is lower than 0.8.  In large environments, the system administrator may prefer batch processing when large amounts of data have to be processed or when tasks demanding a lot of system resources have to be executed on an already loaded system.  Batch processing is also used for optimizing system performance.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_04_01_02_03"><title>Daemons</title>
<para>Daemons are server processes that run continuously.  Most of the time, they are initialized at system startup and then wait in the background until their service is required.  A typical example is the networking daemon, <emphasis>xinetd</emphasis>, which is started in almost every boot procedure.  After the system is booted, the network daemon just sits and waits until a client program, such as an FTP client, needs to connect.</para>
</sect3>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_04_01_03"><title>Process attributes</title>
<para>A process has a series of characteristics:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The process ID or PID: a unique identification number used to refer to the process.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The parent process ID or PPID: the number of the process (PID) that started this process.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Nice number: the degree of friendliness of this process toward other processes (not to be confused with process priority, which is calculated based on this nice number and recent CPU usage of the process).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Terminal or TTY: terminal to which the process is connected.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>User name of the real and effective user (RUID and EUID): the owner of the process.  The real owner is the user issuing the command, the effective user is the one determining access to system resources.  RUID and EUID are usually the same, and the process has the same access rights the issuing user would have.  An example to clarify this: the browser <command>mozilla</command> in <filename>/usr/bin</filename> is owned by user <emphasis>root</emphasis>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>theo:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l /usr/bin/mozilla</command>
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root   root      4996 Nov 20 18:28 /usr/bin/mozilla*

<prompt>theo:~&gt;</prompt> <command>mozilla &amp;</command>
[1] 26595

<prompt>theo:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ps -af</command>
UID     PID  PPID C STIME TTY       TIME CMD
theo  26601 26599 0 15:04 pts/5 00:00:00 /usr/lib/mozilla/mozilla-bin
theo  26613 26569 0 15:04 pts/5 00:00:00 ps -af
</screen>
<para>When user <emphasis>theo</emphasis> starts this program, the process itself and all processes started by the initial process, will be owned by user <emphasis>theo</emphasis> and not by the system administrator.  When <command>mozilla</command> needs access to certain files, that access will be determined by <emphasis>theo</emphasis>'s permissions and not by <emphasis>root</emphasis>'s.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Real and effective group owner (RGID and EGID): The real group owner of a process is the primary group of the user who started the process.  The effective group owner is usually the same, except when SGID access mode has been applied to a file.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_04_01_04"><title>Displaying process information</title>
<para>The <command>ps</command> command is one of the tools for visualizing processes.  This command has several options which can be combined to display different process attributes.</para>
<para>With no options specified, <command>ps</command> only gives information about the current shell and eventual processes:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>theo:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ps</command>
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 4245 pts/7    00:00:00 bash
 5314 pts/7    00:00:00 ps
</screen>
<para>Since this does not give enough information - generally, at least a hundred processes are running on your system - we will usually select particular processes out of the list of all processes, using the <command>grep</command> command in a <emphasis>pipe</emphasis>, see <xref linkend="sect_05_01_02_01"></xref>, as in this line, which will select and display all processes owned by a particular user:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>ps <option>-ef</option> | grep <parameter>username</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>This example shows all processes with a process name of <command>bash</command>, the most common login shell on Linux systems:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>theo:&gt;</prompt> <command>ps auxw | grep bash</command>
brenda   31970  0.0  0.3  6080 1556 tty2   S  Feb23   0:00 -bash

theo      5427  0.0  0.1  3720  548 pts/7  S  19:22   0:00 grep bash
</screen>
<para>In these cases, the <command>grep</command> command finding lines containing the string <emphasis>bash</emphasis> is often displayed as well on systems that have a lot of idletime.  If you don't want this to happen, use the <command>pgrep</command> command.</para>  
<para>Bash shells are a special case: this process list also shows which ones are login shells (where you have to give your username and password, such as when you log in in textmode or do a remote login, as opposed to non-login shells, started up for instance by clicking a terminal window icon).  Such login shells are preceded with a dash (-).</para>

<para>More info can be found the usual way: <command>ps <option>--help</option></command> or <command>man <parameter>ps</parameter></command>.  GNU <command>ps</command> supports different styles of option formats; the above examples don't contain errors.</para>
<para>Note that <command>ps</command> only gives a momentary state of the active processes, it is a one-time recording.  The <command>top</command> program displays a more precise view by updating the results given by <command>ps</command> (with a bunch of options) once every five seconds, generating a new list of the processes causing the heaviest load periodically, meanwhile integrating more information about the swap space in use and the state of the CPU, from the <filename>proc</filename> file system:</para>

<sect3 id="sect_04_01_05_01"><title>Process creation</title>
<para>A new process is created because an existing process makes an exact copy of itself.  This child process has the same environment as its parent, only the process ID number is different.  This procedure is called <emphasis>forking</emphasis>.</para>
<para>After the forking process, the address space of the child process is overwritten with the new process data.  This is done through an <emphasis>exec</emphasis> call to the system.</para>
<para>The <emphasis>fork-and-exec</emphasis> mechanism thus switches an old command with a new, while the environment in which the new program is executed remains the same, including configuration of input and output devices, environment variables and priority.  This mechanism is used to create all UNIX processes, so it also applies to the Linux operating system.  Even the first process, <command>init</command>, with process ID 1, is forked during the boot procedure in the so-called <emphasis>bootstrapping</emphasis> procedure.</para>
<para>This scheme illustrates the fork-and-exec mechanism.  The process ID changes after the fork procedure:</para>

<phrase>Fork creates a new process with the same content as the parent in memory but a different PID, exec replaces the content with the actual data to be processed, PID stays the same.</phrase>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>There are a couple of cases in which <command>init</command> becomes the parent of a process, while the process was not started by <command>init</command>, as we already saw in the <command>pstree</command> example.   Many programs, for instance, <emphasis>daemonize</emphasis> their child processes, so they can keep on running when the parent stops or is being stopped.  A window manager is a typical example; it starts an <command>xterm</command> process that generates a shell that accepts commands.  The window manager then denies any further responsibility and passes the child process to <command>init</command>.  Using this mechanism, it is possible to change window managers without interrupting running applications.</para>
<para>Every now and then things go wrong, even in good families.  In an exceptional case, a process might finish while the parent does not wait for the completion of this process.  Such an unburied process is called a <emphasis>zombie</emphasis> process.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_04_01_05_02"><title>Ending processes</title>
<para>When a process ends normally (it is not killed or otherwise unexpectedly interrupted), the program returns its <emphasis>exit status</emphasis> to the parent.  This exit status is a number returned by the program providing the results of the program's execution.  The system of returning information upon executing a job has its origin in the C programming language in which UNIX has been written.</para>
<para>The return codes can then be interpreted by the parent, or in scripts.  The values of the return codes are program-specific.  This information can usually be found in the man pages of the specified program, for example the <command>grep</command> command returns <computeroutput>-1</computeroutput> if no matches are found, upon which a message on the lines of "No files found" can be printed.  Another example is the Bash Builtin command <command>true</command>, which does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning success.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_04_01_05_03"><title>Signals</title>
<para>Processes end because they receive a signal.  There are multiple signals that you can send to a process.  Use the <command>kill</command> command to send a signal to a process.  The command <command>kill <option>-l</option></command> shows a list of signals.  Most signals are for internal use by the system, or for programmers when they write code.

<sect2 id="sect_04_01_06"><title>SUID and SGID</title>
<para>As promised in the previous chapter, we will now discuss the special modes SUID and SGID in more detail.  These modes exist to provide normal users the ability to execute tasks they would normally not be able to do because of the tight file permission scheme used on UNIX based systems.  In the ideal situation special modes are used as sparsely as possible, since they include security risks.  Linux developers have generally tried to avoid them as much as possible.  The Linux <command>ps</command> version, for example, uses the information stored in the <filename>/proc</filename> file system, which is accessible to everyone, thus avoiding exposition of sensitive system data and resources to the general public.  Before that, and still on older UNIX systems, the <command>ps</command> program needed access to files such as <filename>/dev/mem</filename> and <filename>/dev/kmem</filename>, which had disadvantages because of the permissions and ownerships on these files:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>rita:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l /dev/*mem</command>
crw-r-----    1 root     kmem       1,   2 Aug 30 22:30 /dev/kmem
crw-r-----    1 root     kmem       1,   1 Aug 30 22:30 /dev/mem
</screen>
<para>With older versions of <command>ps</command>, it was not possible to start the program as a common user, unless special modes were applied to it.</para>
<para>While we generally try to avoid applying any special modes, it is sometimes necessary to use an SUID.  An example is the mechanism for changing passwords.  Of course users will want to do this themselves instead of having their password set by the system administrator.  As we know, user names and passwords are listed in the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file, which has these access permissions and owners:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>bea:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l /etc/passwd</command>
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root     1267 Jan 16 14:43 /etc/passwd
</screen>
<para>Still, users need to be able to change their own information in this file.  This is achieved by giving the <command>passwd</command> program special permissions:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>mia:~&gt;</prompt> <command>which passwd</command>
passwd is /usr/bin/passwd

<prompt>mia:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l /usr/bin/passwd</command>
-r-s--x--x    1 root     root    13476 Aug  7 06:03 /usr/bin/passwd*
</screen>
<para>When called, the <command>passwd</command> command will run using the access permissions of <emphasis>root</emphasis>, thus enabling a common user to edit the password file which is owned by the system admin.</para>
<para>SGID modes on a file don't occur nearly as frequently as SUID, because SGID often involves the creation of extra groups.  In some cases, however, we have to go through this trouble in order to build an elegant solution (don't worry about this too much -  the necessary groups are usually created upon installation).  This is the case for the <command>write</command> and <command>wall</command> programs, which are used to send messages to other users' terminals (ttys).  The <command>write</command> command writes a message to a single user, while <command>wall</command> writes to all connected users.</para>
<para>Sending text to another user's terminal or graphical display is normally not allowed.  In order to bypass this problem, a group has been created, which owns all terminal devices.  When the <command>write</command> and <command>wall</command> commands are granted SGID permissions, the commands will run using the access rights as applicable to this group, <emphasis>tty</emphasis> in the example.  Since this group has write access to the destination terminal, also a user having no permissions to use that terminal in any way can send messages to it.</para>
<para>In the example below, user <emphasis>joe</emphasis> first finds out on which terminal his correspondent is connected, using the <command>who</command> command.  Then he sends her a message using the <command>write</command> command.  Also illustrated are the access rights on the <command>write</command> program and on the terminals occupied by the receiving user: it is clear that others than the user owner have no permissions on the device, except for the group owner, which can write to it.</para>
<screen>
<prompt>joe:~&gt;</prompt> <command>which write</command>
write is /usr/bin/write

<sect1 id="sect_04_02"><title>Boot process, Init and shutdown</title>
<sect2 id="sect_04_02_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para> One of the most powerful aspects of Linux concerns its open method of starting and stopping the operating system, where it loads specified programs using their particular configurations, permits you to change those configurations to control the boot process, and shuts down in a graceful and organized way.</para>
<para> Beyond the question of controlling the boot or shutdown process, the open nature of Linux makes it much easier to determine the exact source of most problems associated with starting up or shutting down your system. A basic understanding of this process is quite beneficial to everybody who uses a Linux system.</para>
<para>A lot of Linux systems use <command>lilo</command>, the LInux LOader for booting operating systems.  We will only discuss GRUB, however, which is easier to use and more flexible.  Should you need information about <command>lilo</command>, refer to the man pages and HOWTOs.  Both systems support dual boot installations, we refer to the HOWTOs on this subject for practical examples and background information.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_04_02_02"><title>The boot process</title>
<para>When an x86 computer is booted, the processor looks at the end of the system memory for the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and runs it. The BIOS program is written into permanent read-only memory and is always available for use. The BIOS provides the lowest level interface to peripheral devices and controls the first step of the boot process.</para>
<para> The BIOS tests the system, looks for and checks peripherals, and then looks for a drive to use to boot the system. Usually it checks the floppy drive (or CD-ROM drive on many newer systems) for bootable media, if present, and then it looks to the hard drive. The order of the drives used for booting is usually controlled by a particular BIOS setting on the system.  Once Linux is installed on the hard drive of a system, the BIOS looks for a Master Boot Record (MBR) starting at the first sector on the first hard drive, loads its contents into memory, then passes control to it.</para>
<para> This MBR contains instructions on how to load the GRUB (or LILO) boot-loader, using a pre-selected operating system.  The MBR then loads the boot-loader, which takes over the process (if the boot-loader is installed in the MBR). In the default Red Hat Linux configuration, GRUB uses the settings in the MBR to display boot options in a menu.  Once GRUB has received the correct instructions for the operating system to start, either from its command line or configuration file, it finds the necessary boot file and hands off control of the machine to that operating system.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_04_02_03"><title>GRUB features</title>
<para>This boot method is called <emphasis>direct loading</emphasis> because instructions are used to directly load the operating system, with no intermediary code between the boot-loaders and the operating system's main files (such as the kernel). The boot process used by other operating systems may differ slightly from the above, however. For example, Microsoft's DOS and Windows operating systems completely overwrite anything on the MBR when they are installed without incorporating any of the current MBR's configuration. This destroys any other information stored in the MBR by other operating systems, such as Linux. The Microsoft operating systems, as well as various other proprietary operating systems, are loaded using a chain loading boot method. With this method, the MBR points to the first sector of the partition holding the operating system, where it finds the special files necessary to actually boot that operating system.</para>
<para>
GRUB supports both boot methods, allowing you to use it with almost any operating system, most popular file systems, and almost any hard disk your BIOS can recognize.</para>
<para>GRUB contains a number of other features; the most important include:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>GRUB provides a true command-based, pre-OS environment on x86 machines to allow maximum flexibility in loading operating systems with certain options or gathering information about the system.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>GRUB supports Logical Block Addressing (LBA) mode, needed to access many IDE and all SCSI hard disks.  Before LBA, hard drives could encounter a 1024-cylinder limit, where the BIOS could not find a file after that point.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>GRUB's configuration file is read from the disk every time the system boots, preventing you from having to write over the MBR every time you change the boot options.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>A full description of GRUB may be found by issuing the <command>info <parameter>grub</parameter></command> command or at <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">the GRUB site</ulink>.

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_04_02_04"><title>Init</title>
<para>The kernel, once it is loaded, finds <command>init</command> in <filename>sbin</filename> and executes it.</para>
<para>When <command>init</command> starts, it becomes the parent or grandparent of all of the processes that start up automatically on your Linux system. The first thing <command>init</command> does, is reading its initialization file, <filename>/etc/inittab</filename>.  This instructs <command>init</command> to read an initial configuration script for the environment, which sets the path, starts swapping, checks the file systems, and so on. Basically, this step takes care of everything that your system needs to have done at system initialization: setting the clock, initializing serial ports and so forth.</para>
<para> Then <command>init</command> continues to read the <filename>/etc/inittab</filename> file, which describes how the system should be set up in each run level and sets the default <emphasis>run level</emphasis>.  A run level is a configuration of processes.  All UNIX-like systems can be run in different process configurations, such as the single user mode, which is referred to as run level 1 or run level S (or s).  In this mode, only the system administrator can connect to the system.  It is used to perform maintenance tasks without risks of damaging the system or user data.  Naturally, in this configuration we don't need to offer user services, so they will all be disabled.  Another run level is the reboot run level, or run level 6, which shuts down all running services according to the appropriate procedures and then restarts the system.</para>
<para>Commonly, run level 3 is configured to be text mode on a Linux machine, and run level 5 initializes the graphical login and environment.  More about run levels in the next section, see <xref linkend="sect_04_02_05"></xref>.</para>
<para>After having determined the default run level for your system, <command>init</command> starts all of the background processes necessary for the system to run by looking in the appropriate <filename>rc</filename> directory for that run level.  <command>init</command> runs each of the kill scripts (their file names start with a K) with a stop parameter.  It then runs all of the start scripts (their file names start with an S) in the appropriate run level directory so that all services and applications are started correctly. In fact, you can execute these same scripts manually after the system is finished booting with a command like <command>/etc/init.d/httpd <parameter>stop</parameter></command> or <command>service <parameter>httpd</parameter> <parameter>stop</parameter></command> logged in as <emphasis>root</emphasis>, in this case stopping the web server.</para>
<note><title>Special case</title>
<para>Note that on system startup, the scripts in <filename>rc2.d</filename> and <filename>rc3.d</filename> are usually executed.  In that case, no services are stopped.  There are only services that are started.</para>
</note>
<para> None of the scripts that actually start and stop the services are located in <filename>/etc/rc&lt;x&gt;.d</filename>. Rather, all of the files in <filename>/etc/rc&lt;x&gt;.d</filename> are symbolic links that point to the actual scripts located in <filename>/etc/init.d</filename>. A symbolic link is nothing more than a file that points to another file, and is used in this case because it can be created and deleted without affecting the actual scripts that kill or start the services. The symbolic links to the various scripts are numbered in a particular order so that they start in that order. You can change the order in which the services start up or are killed by changing the name of the symbolic link that refers to the script that actually controls the service.  You can use the same number multiple times if you want a particular service started or stopped right before or after another service, as in the example below, listing the content of <filename>/etc/rc5.d</filename>, where <command>crond</command> and <command>xfs</command> are both started from a linkname starting with <quote>S90</quote>.  In this case, the scripts are started in alphabetical order.</para>

</screen>
<para>After <command>init</command> has progressed through the run levels to get to the default run level, the <filename>/etc/inittab</filename> script forks a <command>getty</command> process for each virtual console (login prompt in text mode).  <command>getty</command> opens tty lines, sets their modes, prints the login prompt, gets the user's name, and then initiates a login process for that user.  This allows users to authenticate themselves to the system and use it.  By default, most systems offer 6 virtual consoles, but as you can see from the <filename>inittab</filename> file, this is configurable.</para>
<para>
<filename>/etc/inittab</filename> can also tell <command>init</command> how it should handle a user pressing <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>+<keycap>Alt</keycap>+<keycap>Delete</keycap> at the console. As the system should be properly shut down and restarted rather than immediately power-cycled, <command>init</command> is told to execute the command <command>/sbin/shutdown <option>-t3 -r</option> <parameter>now</parameter></command>, for instance, when a user hits those keys. In addition, <filename>/etc/inittab</filename> states what <command>init</command> should do in case of power failures, if your system has a UPS unit attached to it.</para>
<para>
On most RPM-based systems the graphical login screen is started in run level 5, where <filename>/etc/inittab</filename> runs a script called <filename>/etc/X11/prefdm</filename>. The <filename>prefdm</filename> script runs the preferred X display manager, based on the contents of the <filename>/etc/sysconfig/desktop</filename> directory.  This is typically <command>gdm</command> if you run GNOME or <command>kdm</command> if you run KDE, but they can be mixed, and there's also the <command>xdm</command> that comes with a standard X installation.</para>
<para>But there are other possibilities as well.  On Debian, for instance, There is an initscript for each of the display managers, and the content of the <filename>/etc/X11/default-display-manager</filename> is used to determine which one to start.  More about the graphical interface can be read in <xref linkend="sect_07_03"></xref>.  Ultimately, your system documentation will explain the details about the higher level aspects of <command>init</command>.</para>
<para>The <filename>/etc/default</filename> and/or <filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename> directories contain entries for a range of functions and services, these are all read at boot time.  The location of the directory containing system defaults might be somewhat different depending on your Linux distribution.</para>
<para>Besides the graphical user environment, a lot of other services may be started as well.  But if all goes well, you should be looking at a login prompt or login screen when the boot process has finished.</para>

<note><title>Other procedures</title>
<para>We explained how SysV <command>init</command> works on x86 based machines.  Startup procedures may vary on other architectures and distributions.  Other systems may use the BSD-style <command>init</command>, where startup files are not split up into multiple <filename>/etc/rc&lt;LEVEL&gt;.d</filename> directories.  It might also be possible that your system uses <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d</filename> instead of <filename>/etc/init.d</filename>.</para></note>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_04_02_05"><title>Init run levels</title>
<para> The idea behind operating different services at different run levels essentially revolves around the fact that different systems can be used in different ways. Some services cannot be used until the system is in a particular state, or <emphasis>mode</emphasis>, such as being ready for more than one user or having networking available.</para>
<para>
There are times in which you may want to operate the system in a lower mode.  Examples are fixing disk corruption problems in run level 1 so no other users can possibly be on the system, or leaving a server in run level 3 without an X session running. In these cases, running services that depend upon a higher system mode to function does not make sense because they will not work correctly anyway. By already having each service assigned to start when its particular run level is reached, you ensure an orderly start up process, and you can quickly change the mode of the machine without worrying about which services to manually start or stop.</para>
<para>Available run levels are generally described in <filename>/etc/inittab</filename>, which is partially shown below:</para>
<screen>

#
# inittab   This file describes how the INIT process should set up
#           the system in a certain run-level.

# Default runlevel. The runlevels are:
#   0 - halt (Do NOT set initdefault to this)
#   1 - Single user mode
#   2 - Multiuser, without NFS 
#	(The same as 3, if you do not have networking)
#   3 - Full multiuser mode
#   4 - unused
#   5 - X11
#   6 - reboot (Do NOT set initdefault to this)
#

</screen>

<para> Feel free to configure runlevels 2 and 4 as you see fit. Many users configure those runlevels in a way that makes the most sense for them while leaving the standard runlevels 3 and 5 alone. This allows them to quickly move in and out of their custom configuration without disturbing the normal set of features at the standard runlevels.</para>
<para> If your machine gets into a state where it will not boot due to a bad <filename>/etc/inittab</filename> or will not let you log in because you have a corrupted <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file (or if you have simply forgotten your password), boot into single-user mode.</para>
<tip><title>No graphics?</title>
<para>When you are working in text mode because you didn't get presented a graphical login screen on the console of your machine, you can normally switch to console 7 or up to have a graphical login.  If this is not the case, check the current run level using the command <command>who <option>-r</option></command>.  If it is set to something else than 5, chances are that the system does not start up in graphical mode by default.  Contact your system administrator or read <command>man init</command> in that case.  Note that switching run levels is done using the <command>init</command> command; switching from a text to a graphical console or vice versa does not involve a run level switch.</para>
</tip>
<para>The discussion of run levels, scripts and configurations in this guide tries to be as general as possible.  Lots of variations exist.  For instance, Gentoo Linux stores scripts in <filename>/etc/runlevels</filename>.  Other systems might first run through (a) lower runlevel(s) and execute all the scripts in there before arriving at the final runlevel and executing those scripts.  Refer to your system documentation for more information.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_04_02_05_01"><title>Tools</title>
<para>The <command>chkconfig</command> or <command>update-rc.d</command> utilities, when installed on your system, provide a simple command-line tool for maintaining the <filename>/etc/init.d</filename> directory hierarchy. These relieve system administrators from having to directly manipulate the numerous symbolic links in the directories under <filename>/etc/rc[x].d</filename>.</para>
<para>
In addition, some systems offer the <command>ntsysv</command> tool, which provides a text-based interface; you may find this easier to use than <command>chkconfig</command>'s command-line interface.  On SuSE Linux, you will find the <command>yast</command> and <command>insserv</command> tools.  For Mandrake easy configuration, you may want to try <emphasis>DrakConf</emphasis>, which allows among other features switching between run levels 3 and 5.  In Mandriva this became the <application>Mandriva Linux COntrol Center</application>.</para>
<para>
Most distributions provide a graphical user interface for configuring processes, check with your system documentation.</para>
<para>
All of these utilities must be run as root.  The system administrator may also manually create the appropriate links in each run level directory in order to start or stop a service in a certain run level.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_04_02_06"><title>Shutdown</title>
<para>UNIX was not made to be shut down, but if you really must, use the <command>shutdown</command> command.  After completing the shutdown procedure, the <option>-h</option> option will halt the system, while <option>-r</option> will reboot it.</para>
<para>The <command>reboot</command> and <command>halt</command> commands are now able to invoke <command>shutdown</command> if run when the system is in runlevels 1-5, and thus ensure proper shutdown of the system,but  it is a bad habit to get into, as not all UNIX/Linux versions have this feature.</para>
<para>If your computer does not power itself down, you should not turn off the computer until you see a message indicating that the system is halted or finished shutting down, in order to give the system the time to unmount all partitions.  Being impatient may cause data loss.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_04_03_01"><title>Work for the system admin</title>
<para>While managing system resources, including processes, is a task for the local system administrator, it doesn't hurt a common user to know something about it, especially where his or her own processes and their optimal execution are concerned.</para>
<para>We will explain a little bit on a theoretical level about system performance, though not as far as hardware optimization and such.  Instead, we will study the daily problems a common user is confronted with, and actions such a user can take to optimally use the resources available.  As we learn in the next section, this is mainly a matter of thinking before acting.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_04_03_03"><title>Performance</title>
<para>To a user, performance means quick execution of commands.  To a system manager, on the other hand, it means much more:  the system admin has to optimize system performance for the whole system, including users, all programs and daemons.  System performance can depend on a thousand tiny things which are not accounted for with the <command>time</command> command:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>the program executing is badly written or doesn't use the computer appropriately</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>access to disks, controllers, display, all kinds of interfaces, etc.</para></listitem>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_04_03_04"><title>Load</title>
<para>In short:  the load depends on what is normal for your system.  My old P133 running a firewall, SSH server, file server, a route daemon, a sendmail server, a proxy server and some other services doesn't complain with 7 users connected; the load is still 0 on average.  Some (multi-CPU) systems I've seen were quite happy with a load of 67.  There is only one way to find out - check the load regularly if you want to know what's normal.  If you don't, you will only be able to measure system load from the response time of the command line, which is a very rough measurement since this speed is influenced by a hundred other factors.</para>
<para>Keep in mind that different systems will behave different with the same load average.  For example, a system with a graphics card supporting hardware acceleration will have no problem rendering 3D images, while the same system with a cheap VGA card will slow down tremendously while rendering.  My old P133 will become quite uncomfortable when I start the X server, but on a modern system you hardly notice the difference in the system load.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_04_03_05"><title>Can I do anything as a user?</title>
<para>A big environment can slow you down.  If you have lots of environment variables set (instead of shell variables), long search paths that are not optimized (errors in setting the path environment variable) and such, the system will need more time to search and read data.</para>
<para>In X, window managers and desktop environments can be real CPU-eaters.  A really fancy desktop comes with a price, even when you can download it for free, since most desktops provide add-ons ad infinitum.  Modesty is a virtue if you don't buy a new computer every year.</para>
<sect3 id="sect_04_03_05_01"><title>Priority</title>
<para>The priority or importance of a job is defined by it's <emphasis>nice</emphasis> number.  A program with a high nice number is friendly to other programs, other users and the system; it is not an important job.  The lower the nice number, the more important a job is and the more resources it will take without sharing them.</para>
<para>Making a job nicer by increasing its nice number is only useful for processes that use a lot of CPU time (compilers, math applications and such).  Processes that always use a lot of I/O time are automatically rewarded by the system and given a higher priority (a lower nice number), for example keyboard input always gets highest priority on a system.</para>
<para>Defining the priority of a program is done with the <command>nice</command> command.</para>
<para>Most systems also provide the BSD <command>renice</command> command, which allows you to change the <emphasis>niceness</emphasis> of a running command.  Again, read the man page for your system-specific information.</para>
<caution><title>Interactive programs</title>
<para>It is NOT a good idea to <command>nice</command> or <command>renice</command> an interactive program or a job running in the foreground.</para></caution>
<para>Use of these commands is usually a task for the system administrator.  Read the man page for more info on extra functionality available to the system administrator.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_04_03_05_02"><title>CPU resources</title>
<para>On every Linux system, many programs want to use the CPU(s) at the same time, even if you are the only user on the system.  Every program needs a certain amount of cycles on the CPU to run.  There may be times when there are not enough cycles because the CPU is too busy.  The <command>uptime</command> command is wildly inaccurate (it only displays averages, you have to know what is normal), but far from being useless.  There are some actions you can undertake if you think your CPU is to blame for the unresponsiveness of your system:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Run heavy programs when the load is low.  This may be the case on your system during the night.  See next section for scheduling.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Prevent the system from doing unnecessary work: stop daemons and programs that you don't use, use <command>locate</command> instead of a heavy <command>find</command>, ...</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Run big jobs with a low priority</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>If none of these solutions are an option in your particular situation, you may want to upgrade your CPU.  On a UNIX machine this is a job for the system admin.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_04_03_05_03"><title>Memory resources</title>
<para>When the currently running processes expect more memory than the system has physically available, a Linux system will not crash; it will start paging, or <emphasis>swapping</emphasis>, meaning the process uses the memory on disk or in swap space, moving contents of the physical memory (pieces of running programs or entire programs in the case of swapping) to disk, thus reclaiming the physical memory to handle more processes.  This slows the system down enormously since access to disk is much slower than access to memory.  The <command>top</command> command can be used to display memory and swap use.   Systems using glibc offer the <command>memusage</command> and <command>memusagestat</command> commands to visualize memory usage.</para>
<para>If you find that a lot of memory and swap space are being used, you can try:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Killing, stopping or renicing those programs that use a big chunk of memory</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Adding more memory (and in some cases more swap space) to the system.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Tuning system performance, which is beyond the scope of this document.  See the reading list in <xref linkend="app1"></xref> for more.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_04_03_05_04"><title>I/O resources</title>
<para>While I/O limitations are a major cause of stress for system admins, the Linux system offers rather poor utilities to measure I/O performance.  The <command>ps</command>, <command>vmstat</command> and <command>top</command> tools give some indication about how many programs are waiting for I/O; <command>netstat</command> displays network interface statistics, but there are virtually no tools available to measure the I/O response to system load, and the <command>iostat</command> command gives a brief overview of general I/O usage.  Various graphical front-ends exist to put the output of these commands in a humanly understandable form.</para>
<para>Each device has its own problems, but the bandwidth available to network interfaces and the  bandwidth available to disks are the two primary causes of bottlenecks in I/O performance.</para>
<para>Network I/O problems:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Network overload:</para>
     <para>The amount of data transported over the network is larger than the network's capacity, resulting in slow execution of every network related task for all users.  They can be solved by cleaning up the network (which mainly involves disabling protocols and services that you don't need) or by reconfiguring the network (for example use of subnets, replacing hubs with switches, upgrading interfaces and equipment).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Network integrity problems:</para>
     <para>Occurs when data is transferred incorrectly.  Solving this kind of problem can only be done by isolating the faulty element and replacing it.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Disk I/O problems:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>per-process transfer rate too low:</para>
<para>Read or write speed for a single process is not sufficient.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>aggregate transfer rate too low:</para>
<para>The maximum total bandwidth that the system can provide to all programs that run is not enough.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>This kind of problem is more difficult to detect, and usually takes extra hardware in order to re-divide data streams over buses, controllers and disks, if overloaded hardware is cause of the problem.  One solution to solve this is a RAID array configuration optimized for input and output actions.  This way, you get to keep the same hardware.  An upgrade to faster buses, controlers and disks is usually the other option.</para>
<para>If overload is not the cause, maybe your hardware is gradually failing, or not well connected to the system.  Check contacts, connectors and plugs to start with.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_04_03_05_05"><title>Users</title>
<para>Users can be divided in several classes, depending on their behavior with resource usage:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Users who run a (large) number of small jobs: you, the beginning Linux user, for instance.</para></listitem> 
<listitem><para>Users who run relatively few but large jobs: users running simulations, calculations, emulators or other programs that eat a lot of memory, and usually these users have accompanying large data files.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Users who run few jobs but use a lot of CPU time (developers and the like).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>You can see that system requirements may vary for each class of users, and that it can be hard to satisfy everyone.  If you are on a multi-user system, it is useful (and fun) to find out habits of other users and the system, in order to get the most out of it for your specific purposes.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_04_03_05_06"><title>Graphical tools</title>
<para>For the graphical environment, there are a whole bunch of monitoring tools available.  Below is a screen shot of the Gnome System Monitor, which has features for displaying and searching process information, and monitoring system resources:</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_04_03_05_07"><title>Interrupting your processes</title>
<para>As a non-privileged user, you can only influence your own processes.  We already saw how you can display processes and filter out processes that belong to a particular user, and what possible restrictions can occur.  When you see that one of your processes is eating too much of the system's resources, there are two things that you can do:</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>Make the process use less resources without interrupting it;</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Stop the process altogether.</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
<para>In the case that you want the process to continue to run, but you also want to give the other processes on the system a chance, you can <command>renice</command> the process.  Appart from using the <command>nice</command> or <command>renice</command> commands, <command>top</command> is an easy way of spotting the troublesome process(es) and reducing priority.</para>
<para>Identify the process in the <quote>NI</quote> column, it will most likely have a negative priority.  Type <command>r</command> and enter the process ID of the process that you want to renice.  Then enter the nice value, for instance <quote>20</quote>.  That means that from now on, this process will take 1/5 of the CPU cycles at the most.</para>
<para>Examples of processes that you want to keep on running are emulators, virtual machines, compilers and so on.</para>

<para>If you want to stop a process because it hangs or is going totally berserk in the way of I/O consumption, file creation or use of other system resources, use the <command>kill</command> command.  If you have the opportunity, first try to kill the process softly, sending it the <emphasis>SIGTERM</emphasis> signal.  This is an instruction to terminate whatever it is doing, according to procedures as described in the code of the program:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>joe:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ps <option>-ef</option></command> | <command>grep <parameter>mozilla</parameter></command>
joe    25822	1  0 Mar11 ?	00:34:04 /usr/lib/mozilla-1.4.1/mozilla-

<prompt>joe:~&gt;</prompt> <command>kill <option>-15</option> <parameter>25822</parameter></command>
</screen>
<para>In the example above, user <emphasis>joe</emphasis> stopped his Mozilla browser because it hung.</para>
<para>Some processes are a little bit harder to get rid of.  If you have the time, you might want to send them the SIGINT signal to interrupt them.  If that does not do the trick either, use the strongest signal, SIGKILL.  In the example below, <emphasis>joe</emphasis> stops a Mozilla that is frozen:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>joe:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ps <option>-ef</option></command> | <command>grep <parameter>mozilla</parameter></command>
joe    25915	1  0 Mar11 ?	00:15:06 /usr/lib/mozilla-1.4.1/mozilla-

<prompt>joe:~&gt;</prompt> <command>kill <option>-9</option> <parameter>25915</parameter></command>

<prompt>joe:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ps <option>-ef</option></command> | <command>grep <parameter>25915</parameter></command>
joe	2634 32273 0 18:09 pts/4   00:00:00 grep 25915
</screen>
<para>In such cases, you might want to check that the process is really dead, using the <command>grep</command> filter again on the PID.  If this only returns the <command>grep</command> process, you can be sure that you succeeded in stopping the process.</para>
<para>Among processes that are hard to kill is your shell.  And that is a good thing: if they would be easy to kill, you woud loose your shell every time you type <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>-<keycap>C</keycap> on the command line accidentally, since this is equivalent to sending a SIGINT.</para>
<note><title>UNIX without pipes is almost unthinkable</title>
<para>The usage of pipes (|) for using output of one command as input of another is explained in the next chapter, <xref linkend="chap_05"></xref>.</para>
</note>
<para>In a graphical environment, the <command>xkill</command> program is very easy to use.  Just type the name of the command, followed by an <keycap>Enter</keycap> and select the window of the application that you want to stop.  It is rather dangerous because it sends a SIGKILL by default, so only use it when an application hangs.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_04_04"><title>Scheduling processes</title>
<sect2 id="sect_04_04_01"><title>Use that idle time!</title>
<para>A Linux system can have a lot to suffer from, but it usually suffers only during office hours.  Whether in an office environment, a server room or at home, most Linux systems are just idling away during the morning, the evening, the nights and weekends.  Using this idle time can be a lot cheaper than buying those machines you'd absolutely need if you want everything done at the same time.</para>
<para>There are three types of delayed execution:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Waiting a little while and then resuming job execution, using the <command>sleep</command> command.  Execution time depends on the system time at the moment of submission.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Running a command at a specified time, using the <command>at</command> command.  Execution of the job(s) depends on system time, not the time of submission.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Regularly running a command on a monthly, weekly, daily or hourly basis, using the <command>cron</command> facilities.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The following sections discuss each possibility.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_04_04_02"><title>The sleep command</title>
<para>The Info page on sleep is probably one of the shortest there is.  All sleep does is wait.  By default the time to wait is expressed in seconds.</para>
<para>So why does it exist?  Some practical examples:</para>
<para>Somebody calls you on the phone, you say "Yes I'll be with you in half an hour" but you're about drowned in work as it is and bound to forget your lunch:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>(sleep <parameter>1800</parameter>; echo <parameter>"Lunch time.."</parameter>) &amp;</command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>When you can't use the <command>at</command> command for some reason, it's five o'clock, you want to go home but there's still work to do and right now somebody is eating system resources:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>(sleep <parameter>10000</parameter>; myprogram) &amp;</command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>Make sure there's an auto-logout on your system, and that you log out or lock your desktop/office when submitting this kind of job, or run it in a <command>screen</command> session.</para>
<para>When you run a series of printouts of large files, but you want other users to be able to print in between:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>lp <filename>lotoftext</filename>; sleep <parameter>900</parameter>; lp <filename>hugefile</filename>; sleep <parameter>900</parameter>; lp <filename>anotherlargefile</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>Printing files is discussed in <xref linkend="chap_08"></xref>.</para>
<para>Programmers often use the sleep command to halt script or program execution for a certain time.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_04_04_03"><title>The at command</title>
<para>The <command>at</command> command executes commands at a given time, using your default shell unless you tell the command otherwise (see the man page).</para>
<para>The options to <command>at</command> are rather user-friendly, which is demonstrated in the examples below:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>steven@home:~&gt;</prompt> <command>at tomorrow + 2 days</command>
warning: commands will be executed using (in order) a) $SHELL
        b) login shell c) /bin/sh

</screen>
<para>Typing <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>+<keycap>D</keycap> quits the <command>at</command> utility and generates the <quote>EOT</quote> message.</para>
<para>User <emphasis>steven</emphasis> does a strange thing here combining two commands; we will study this sort of practice in <xref linkend="chap_05"></xref>, Redirecting Input and Output.</para>

<prompt>at&gt;</prompt> &lt;EOT&gt;
job 2 at 2001-06-14 02:00
</screen>
<para>The <option>-m</option> option sends mail to the user when the job is done, or explains when a job can't be done.  The command <command>atq</command> lists jobs; perform this command before submitting jobs in order prevent them from starting at the same time as others.  With the <command>atrm</command> command you can remove scheduled jobs if you change your mind.</para>
<para>It is a good idea to pick strange execution times, because system jobs are often run at <quote>round</quote> hours, as you can see in <xref linkend="sect_04_04_04"></xref> the next section.  For example, jobs are often run at exactly 1 o'clock in the morning (e.g. system indexing to update a standard locate database), so entering a time of 0100 may easily slow your system down rather than fire it up.  To prevent jobs from running all at the same time, you may also use the <command>batch</command> command, which queues processes and feeds the work in the queue to the system in an evenly balanced way, preventing excessive bursts of system resource usage.  See the Info pages for more information.</para>


</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_04_04_04"><title>Cron and crontab</title>
<para>The cron system is managed by the cron daemon.  It gets information about which programs and when they should run from the system's and users' crontab entries.  Only the root user has access to the system crontabs, while each user should only have access to his own crontabs.  On some systems (some) users may not have access to the cron facility.</para>
<para>At system startup the cron daemon searches <filename>/var/spool/cron/</filename> for crontab entries which are named after accounts in <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>, it searches <filename>/etc/cron.d/</filename> and it searches <filename>/etc/crontab</filename>, then uses this information every minute to check if there is something to be done.  It executes commands as the user who owns the crontab file and mails any output of commands to the owner.</para>
<para>On systems using Vixie cron, jobs that occur hourly, daily, weekly and monthly are kept in separate directories in <filename>/etc</filename> to keep an overview, as opposed to the standard UNIX cron function, where all tasks are entered into one big file.</para>
<para>Example of a Vixie crontab file:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[root@blob /etc]#</prompt> <command>more crontab</command>
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
MAILTO=root
HOME=/

# run-parts
# commands to execute every hour
01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
# commands to execute every day
02 4 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily
# commands to execute every week
22 4 * * 0 root run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
commands to execute every month
42 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly
</screen>
<para>Some variables are set, and after that there's the actual scheduling, one line per job, starting with 5 time and date fields.  The first field contains the minutes (from 0 to 59), the second defines the hour of execution (0-23), the third is day of the month (1-31), then the number of the month (1-12), the last is day of the week (0-7, both 0 and 7 are Sunday).  An asterisk in these fields represents the total acceptable range for the field.  Lists are allowed; to execute a job from Monday to Friday enter 1-5 in the last field, to execute a job on Monday, Wednesday and Friday enter 1,3,5.</para>
<para>Then comes the user who should run the processes which are listed in the last column.  The example above is from a Vixie cron configuration where root runs the program <command>run-parts</command> on regular intervals, with the appropriate directories as options.  In these directories, the actual jobs to be executed at the scheduled time are stored as shell scripts, like this little script that is run daily to update the database used by the <command>locate</command> command:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>billy@ahost cron.daily]$</prompt> <command>cat slocate.cron</command>

/usr/bin/updatedb -f "nfs,smbfs,ncpfs,proc,devpts" -e \
"/tmp,/var/tmp, /usr/tmp,/afs,/net"
</screen>
<para>Users are supposed to edit their crontabs in a safe way using the <command>crontab <option>-e</option></command> command.  This will prevent a user from accidentally opening more than one copy of his/her crontab file.  The default editor is <command>vi</command> (see <xref linkend="chap_06"></xref>, but you can use any text editor, such as <command>gvim</command> or <command>gedit</command> if you feel more comfortable with a GUI editor.</para> 
<para>When you quit, the system will tell you that a new crontab is installed.</para>
<para>This crontab entry reminds <emphasis>billy</emphasis> to go to his sports club every Thursday night:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>billy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>crontab -l</command>

<para>After adding a new scheduled task, the system will tell you that a new crontab is installed.  You do not need to restart the <command>crond</command> daemon for the changes to take effect.  In the example, <emphasis>billy</emphasis> added a new line pointing to a backup script:</para>

<sect1 id="sect_05_01"><title>Simple redirections</title>
<sect2 id="sect_05_01_01"><title>What are standard input and standard output?</title>
<para>
Most Linux commands read input, such as a file or another attribute for the command, and write output.  By default, input is being given with the keyboard, and output is displayed on your screen.  Your keyboard is your <quote>standard input</quote> (stdin) device, and the screen or a particular terminal window is the <quote>standard output</quote> (stdout) device.
</para>
<para>However, since Linux is a flexible system, these default settings don't necessarily have to be applied.  The standard output, for example, on a heavily monitored server in a large environment may be a printer.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_05_01_02"><title>The redirection operators</title>
<sect3 id="sect_05_01_02_01"><title>Output redirection with &gt; and |</title>
<para>Sometimes you will want to put output of a command in a file, or you may want to issue another command on the output of one command.  This is known as redirecting output.  Redirection is done using either the <quote>&gt;</quote> (greater-than symbol), or using the <quote>|</quote> (pipe) operator which sends the standard output of one command to another command as standard input.</para>
<para>As we saw before, the <command>cat</command> command concatenates files and puts them all together to the standard output.  By redirecting this output to a file, this file name will be created - or overwritten if it already exists, so take care.</para>
<screen>
<prompt>nancy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat test1</command>
some words

<prompt>nancy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat test2</command>
some other words

<prompt>nancy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat test1 test2 &gt; test3</command>

<prompt>nancy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat test3</command>
some words
some other words
</screen>

<warning><title>Don't overwrite!</title>
<para>Be careful not to overwrite existing (important) files when redirecting output.  Many shells, including Bash, have a built-in feature to protect you from that risk: <command>noclobber</command>.  See the Info pages for more information.  In Bash, you would want to add the <command>set <option>-o</option> <parameter>noclobber</parameter></command> command to your <filename>.bashrc</filename> configuration file in order to prevent accidental overwriting of files.</para></warning>


<para>Redirecting <quote>nothing</quote> to an existing file is equal to emptying the file:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>nancy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l list</command>
-rw-rw-r--    1 nancy   nancy     117 Apr  2 18:09 list

<prompt>nancy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>&gt; list</command>

<prompt>nancy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l list</command>
-rw-rw-r--    1 nancy   nancy       0 Apr  4 12:01 list
</screen>
<para>This process is called <emphasis>truncating</emphasis>.</para>
<para>The same redirection to an nonexistent file will create a new empty file with the given name:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>nancy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l newlist</command>
ls: newlist: No such file or directory

<prompt>nancy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>&gt; newlist</command>

<prompt>nancy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -l newlist</command>
-rw-rw-r--  1 nancy   nancy	    0 Apr  4 12:05 newlist
</screen>
<para><xref linkend="chap_07"></xref> gives some more examples on the use of this sort of redirection.</para>
<para>Some examples using piping of commands:</para>
<para>To find a word within some text, display all lines matching <quote>pattern1</quote>, and exclude lines also matching <quote>pattern2</quote> from being displayed:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>grep <parameter>pattern1</parameter> <filename>file</filename> | grep <option>-v</option> <parameter>pattern2</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>To display output of a directory listing one page at a time:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>ls <option>-la</option> | less</command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>To find a file in a directory:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>ls <option>-l</option> | grep <parameter>part_of_file_name</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_05_01_02_02"><title>Input redirection</title>
<para>In another case, you may want a file to be the input for a command that normally wouldn't accept a file as an option.  This redirecting of input is done using the <quote>&lt;</quote> (less-than symbol) operator.</para>
<para>Below is an example of sending a file to somebody, using input redirection.</para>
<screen>
<prompt>andy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>mail mike@somewhere.org &lt; to_do</command>
</screen>
<para>If the user <emphasis>mike</emphasis> exists on the system, you don't need to type the full address.  If you want to reach somebody on the Internet, enter the fully qualified address as an argument to <command>mail</command>.</para>
<para>This reads a bit more difficult than the beginner's <command>cat <filename>file</filename> | mail <parameter>someone</parameter></command>, but it is of course a much more elegant way of using the available tools.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_05_01_02_03"><title>Combining redirections</title>
<para>The following example combines input and output redirection.  The file <filename>text.txt</filename> is first checked for spelling mistakes, and the output is redirected to an error log file:</para>
<para><command>spell &lt; <filename>text.txt</filename> &gt; <filename>error.log</filename></command></para>
<para>The following command lists all commands that you can issue to examine another file when using <command>less</command>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>mike:~&gt;</prompt> <command>less --help | grep -i examine</command>
  :e [file]      Examine a new file.
  :n          *  Examine the (N-th) next file from the command line.
  :p          *  Examine the (N-th) previous file from the command line.
  :x          *  Examine the first (or N-th) file from the command line.
</screen>
<para>The <option>-i</option> option is used for case-insensitive searches - remember that UNIX systems are very case-sensitive.</para>
<para>If you want to save output of this command for future reference, redirect the output to a file:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>mike:~&gt;</prompt> <command>less --help | grep -i examine &gt; examine-files-in-less</command>

<prompt>mike:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat examine-files-in-less</command>
  :e [file]      Examine a new file.
  :n          *  Examine the (N-th) next file from the command line.
  :p          *  Examine the (N-th) previous file from the command line.
  :x          *  Examine the first (or N-th) file from the command line.
</screen>
<para>Output of one command can be piped into another command virtually as many times as you want, just as long as these commands would normally read input from standard input and write output to the standard output.  Sometimes they don't, but then there may be special options that instruct these commands to behave according to the standard definitions; so read the documentation (man and info pages) of the commands you use if you should encounter errors.</para>
<para>Again, make sure you don't use names of existing files that you still need.  Redirecting output to existing files will replace the content of those files.</para>

</sect3>


<sect3 id="sect_05_01_02_04"><title>The &gt;&gt; operator</title>
<para>Instead of overwriting file data, you can also append text to an existing file using two subsequent greater-than signs:</para>
<para>Example:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>mike:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat <filename>wishlist</filename></command>
more money
less work

<prompt>mike:~&gt;</prompt> <command>date &gt;&gt; <filename>wishlist</filename></command>

<prompt>mike:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat <filename>wishlist</filename></command>
more money
less work
Thu Feb 28 20:23:07 CET 2002
</screen>
<para>The <command>date</command> command would normally put the last line on the screen; now it is appended to the file <filename>wishlist</filename>.
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="sect_05_02"><title>Advanced redirection features</title>
<sect2 id="sect_05_02_01"><title>Use of file descriptors</title> 
<para>There are three types of I/O, which each have their own identifier, called a file descriptor:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>standard input: 0</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>standard output: 1</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>standard error: 2</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is omitted, and the first character of the redirection operator is &lt;, the redirection refers to the standard input (file descriptor 0).  If the first character of the redirection operator is &gt;, the redirection refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).</para>

<para>Some practical examples will make this more clear:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>ls &gt; <filename>dirlist</filename> 2&gt;&amp;1</command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>will direct both standard output and standard error to the file <filename>dirlist</filename>, while the command</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>ls 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; <filename>dirlist</filename></command></cmdsynopsis> 
<para>will only direct standard output to <filename>dirlist</filename>.  This can be a useful option for programmers.</para>

<para>Things are getting quite complicated here, don't confuse the use of the ampersand here with the use of it in <xref linkend="sect_04_01_02_01"></xref>, where the ampersand is used to run a process in the background.  Here, it merely serves as an indication that the number that follows is not a file name, but rather a location that the data stream is pointed to.  Also note that the bigger-than sign should not be separated by spaces from the number of the file descriptor.  If it would be separated, we would be pointing the output to a file again.  The example below demonstrates this:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[nancy@asus /var/tmp]$ </prompt><command>ls 2&gt; <filename>tmp</filename></command>

<prompt>[nancy@asus /var/tmp]$ </prompt><command>ls -l <filename>tmp</filename></command>
-rw-rw-r--  1 nancy nancy 0 Sept  7 12:58 tmp

<prompt>[nancy@asus /var/tmp]$ </prompt><command>ls 2 &gt; <filename>tmp</filename></command>
ls: 2: No such file or directory
</screen>
<para>The first command that <emphasis>nancy</emphasis> executes is correct (eventhough no errors are generated and thus the file to which standard error is redirected is empty).  The second command expects that <filename>2</filename> is a file name, which does not exist in this case, so an error is displayed.</para>
<para>All these features are explained in detail in the Bash Info pages.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_05_02_02"><title>Examples</title>
<sect3 id="sect_05_02_02_01"><title>Analyzing errors</title>
<para>If your process generates a lot of errors, this is a way to thoroughly examine them:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>command 2&gt;&amp;1 | less</command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>This is often used when creating new software using the <command>make</command> command, such as in:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>andy:~/newsoft&gt;</prompt> <command>make all 2&gt;&amp;1 | less</command>
--output ommitted--
</screen>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_05_02_02_02"><title>Separating standard output from standard error</title>
<para>Constructs like these are often used by programmers, so that output is displayed in one terminal window, and errors in another.  Find out which pseudo terminal you are using issuing the <command>tty</command> command first:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>andy:~/newsoft&gt;</prompt> <command>make all 2&gt; /dev/pts/7</command>
</screen>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="sect_05_02_02_03"><title>Writing to output and files simultaneously</title>
<para>You can use the <command>tee</command> command to copy input to standard output and one or more output files in one move.  Using the <option>-a</option> option to <command>tee</command> results in appending input to the file(s).  This command is useful if you want to both see and save output.  The <command>&gt;</command> and <command>&gt;&gt;</command> operators do not allow to perform both actions simultaneously.</para>
<para>This tool is usually called on through a pipe (<command>|</command>), as demonstrated in the example below:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>mireille ~/test&gt;</prompt> <command>date | tee <filename>file1 file2</filename></command>
Thu Jun 10 11:10:34 CEST 2004

<prompt>mireille ~/test&gt;</prompt> <command>cat <filename>file1</filename></command>
Thu Jun 10 11:10:34 CEST 2004

<prompt>mireille ~/test&gt;</prompt> <command>cat <filename>file2</filename></command>
Thu Jun 10 11:10:34 CEST 2004

<prompt>mireille ~/test&gt;</prompt> <command>uptime | tee <option>-a</option> <filename>file2</filename></command>
 11:10:51 up 21 days, 21:21, 57 users,  load average: 0.04, 0.16, 0.26

<prompt>mireille ~/test&gt;</prompt> <command>cat <filename>file2</filename></command>
Thu Jun 10 11:10:34 CEST 2004

<sect1 id="sect_05_03">
<title>Filters</title>
<para>When a program performs operations on input and writes the result to the standard output, it is called a filter.  One of the most common uses of filters is to restructure output.  We'll discuss a couple of the most important filters below.</para>
<sect2 id="sect_05_03_01"><title>More about grep</title>
<para>As we saw in <xref linkend="sect_03_03_03_04"></xref>, <command>grep</command> scans the output line per line, searching for matching patterns.  All lines containing the pattern will be printed to standard output.  This behavior can be reversed using the <option>-v</option> option.
</para>
<para>Some examples: suppose we want to know which files in a certain directory have been modified in February:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>jenny:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -la | grep Feb</command>
</screen>
<para>The <command>grep</command> command, like most commands, is case sensitive. Use the <option>-i</option> option to make no difference between upper and lower case.  A lot of GNU extensions are available as well, such as <option>--colour</option>, which is helpful to highlight searchterms in long lines, and <option>--after-context</option>, which prints the number of lines after the last matching line.  You can issue a recursive <command>grep</command> that searches all subdirectories of encountered directories using the <option>-r</option> option.  As usual, options can be combined.</para>
<para>Regular expressions can be used to further detail the exact character matches you want to select out of all the input lines.  The best way to start with regular expressions is indeed to read the <command>grep</command> documentation.  An excellent chapter is included in the <command>info <parameter>grep</parameter></command> page.  Since it would lead us too far discussing the ins and outs of regular expressions, it is strongly advised to start here if you want to know more about them.</para>
<para>Play around a bit with <command>grep</command>, it will be worth the trouble putting some time in this most basic but very powerful filtering command.  The exercises at the end of this chapter will help you to get started, see <xref linkend="sect_05_05"></xref>.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_05_03_02"><title>Filtering output</title>
<para>The command <command>sort</command> arranges lines in alphabetical order by default:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>thomas:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat people-I-like | sort</command>
Auntie Emmy
Boyfriend
Dad
Grandma
Mum
My boss
</screen>
<para>But there are many more things <command>sort</command> can do.  Looking at the file size, for instance.  With this command, directory content is sorted smallest files first, biggest files last:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>ls <option>-la</option> | sort <option>-nk</option> <parameter>5</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
<note><title>Old sort syntax</title>
<para>You might obtain the same result with <command>ls <option>-la</option> | sort <option>+4n</option></command>, but this is an old form which does not comply with the current standards.</para></note>
<para>The <command>sort</command> command is also used in combination with the <command>uniq</command> program (or <command>sort <option>-u</option></command>) to sort output and filter out double entries:</para>

<sect1 id="sect_06_01"><title>Text editors</title>
<sect2 id="sect_06_01_01"><title>Why should I use an editor?</title>
<para>It is very important to be able to use at least one text mode editor.  Knowing how to use an editor on your system is the first step to independence.</para>
<para>We will need to master an editor by the next chapter as we need it to edit files that influence our environment.  As an advanced user, you may want to start writing scripts, or books, develop websites or new programs.  Mastering an editor will immensely improve your productivity as well as your capabilities.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_06_01_02"><title>Which editor should I use?</title>
<para>Our focus is on text editors, which can also be used on systems without a graphical environment and in terminal windows.  The additional advantage of mastering a text editor is in using it on remote machines.  Since you don't need to transfer the entire graphical environment over the network, working with text editors tremendously improves network speed.</para>
<para>There are, as usual, multiple ways to handle the problem.  Let's see what editors are commonly available:</para>
<sect3 id="sect_06_01_02_01"><title>Ed</title>
<para>The <command>ed</command> editor is line-oriented and used to create, display, modify and otherwise manipulate text files, both interactively and by use in shell scripts.</para>
<para><command>ed</command> is the original text editor on UNIX machines, and thus widely available.  For most purposes, however, it is superceded by full-screen editors such as <command>emacs</command> and <command>vi</command>, see below.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_06_01_02_02"><title>GNU Emacs</title>
<para>Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor, known on many UNIX and other systems.  The text being edited is visible on the screen and is updated automatically as you type your commands.  It is a real-time editor because the display is updated very frequently, usually after each character or pair of characters you type.  This minimizes the amount of information you must keep in your head as you edit.  Emacs is called advanced because it provides facilities that go beyond simple insertion and deletion:  controlling subprocesses; automatic indentation of programs; viewing two or more files at once; editing formatted text; and dealing in terms of characters, words, lines, sentences, paragraphs, and pages, as well as expressions and comments in several different programming languages.</para>
<para><emphasis>Self-documenting</emphasis> means that at any time you can type a special character, <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>+<keycap>H</keycap>, to find out what your options are.  You can also use it to find out what any command does, or to find all the commands that pertain to a topic.  <emphasis>Customizable</emphasis> means that you can change the definitions of Emacs commands in little ways.  For example, if you use a programming language in which comments start with `&lt;**' and end with `**&gt;', you can tell the Emacs comment manipulation commands to use those strings.  Another sort of customization is rearrangement of the command set.  For example, if you prefer the four basic cursor motion commands (up, down, left and right) on keys in a diamond pattern on the keyboard, you can rebind the keys that way.</para>
<para><emphasis>Extensible</emphasis> means that you can go beyond simple customization and write entirely new commands, programs in the Lisp language that are run by Emacs's own Lisp interpreter.  Emacs is an <emphasis>online</emphasis> extensible system, which means that it is divided into many functions that call each other, any of which can be redefined in the middle of an editing session.  Almost any part of Emacs can be replaced without making a separate copy of all of Emacs.  Most of the editing commands of Emacs are written in Lisp already; the few exceptions could have been written in Lisp but are written in C for efficiency.  Although only a programmer can write an extension, anybody can use it afterward.</para>
<para>When run under the X Window System (started as <command>xemacs</command>) Emacs provides its own menus and convenient bindings to mouse buttons.  But Emacs can provide many of the benefits of a window system on a text-only terminal.  For instance, you can look at or edit several files at once, move text between files, and edit files while running shell commands.</para> 

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_06_01_02_03"><title>Vi(m)</title>
<para>Vim stands for Vi IMproved.  It used to be Vi IMitation, but there are so many improvements that a name change was appropriate.  Vim is a text editor which includes almost all the commands from the UNIX program <command>vi</command> and a lot of new ones.</para>
<para>Commands in the <command>vi</command> editor are entered using only the keyboard, which has the advantage that you can keep your fingers on the keyboard and your eyes on the screen, rather than moving your arm repeatedly to the mouse.  For those who want it, mouse support and a GUI version with scrollbars and menus can be activated.</para>
<para>We will refer to <command>vi</command> or <command>vim</command> throughout this book for editing files, while you are of course free to use the editor of your choice.  However, we recommend to at least get the <command>vi</command> basics in the fingers, because it is the standard text editor on almost all UNIX systems, while <command>emacs</command> can be an optional package.  There may be small differences between different computers and terminals, but the main point is that if you can work with <command>vi</command>, you can survive on any UNIX system.</para>
<para>Apart from the <command>vim</command> command, the <application>vIm</application> packages may also provide <command>gvim</command>, the Gnome version of <command>vim</command>.  Beginning users might find this easier to use, because the menus offer help when you forgot or don't know how to perform a particular editing task using the standard <command>vim</command> commands.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_06_02"><title>Using the Vim editor</title>
<sect2 id="sect_06_02_01"><title>Two modes</title>
<para>The <command>vi</command> editor is a very powerful tool and has a very extensive built-in manual, which you can activate using the <command>:help</command> command when the program is started (instead of using <command>man</command> or <command>info</command>, which don't contain nearly as much information).  We will only discuss the very basics here to get you started.</para>
<para>What makes <command>vi</command> confusing to the beginner is that it can operate in two modes:  command mode and insert mode.  The editor always starts in command mode.  Commands move you through the text, search, replace, mark blocks and perform other editing tasks, and some of them switch the editor to insert mode.</para>
<para>This means that each key has not one, but likely two meanings:  it can either represent a command for the editor when in command mode, or a character that you want in a text when in insert mode.</para>

It is possible that the system gives a little alert when you are already in command mode when hitting <keycap>Esc</keycap>, by beeping or giving a visual bell (a flash on the screen).  This is normal behavior.</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_06_02_03"><title>The easy way</title>
<para>Instead of reading the text, which is quite boring, you can use the vimtutor to learn you first Vim commands.  This is a thirty minute tutorial that teaches the most basic Vim functionality in eight easy exercises.  While you can't learn everything about <command>vim</command> in just half an hour, the tutor is designed to describe enough of the commands that you will be able to easily use Vim as an all-purpose editor.</para>
<para>In UNIX and MS Windows, if Vim has been properly installed, you can start this program from the shell or command line, entering the <command>vimtutor</command> command.  This will make a copy of the tutor file, so that you can edit it without the risk of damaging the original.  There are a few translated versions of the tutor.  To find out if yours is available, use the two-letter language code.  For French this would be <command>vimtutor <parameter>fr</parameter></command> (if installed on the system).</para>

<sect1 id="sect_06_03"><title>Linux in the office</title>
<sect2 id="sect_06_03_01"><title>History</title>
<para>Throughout the last decade the office domain has typically been dominated by MS Office, and, let's face it: the Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint formats are industry standards that you will have to deal with sooner or later.</para>
<para>This monopoly situation of Microsoft proved to be a big disadvantage for getting new users to Linux, so a group of German developers started the StarOffice project, that was, and is still, aimed at making an MS Office clone.  Their company, StarDivision, was acquired by Sun Microsystems by the end of the 1990s, just before the 5.2 release.  Sun continues development but restricted access to the sources.  Nevertheless, development on the original set of sources continues in the Open Source community, which had to rename the project to OpenOffice.  OpenOffice is now available for a variety of platforms, including MS Windows, Linux, MacOS and Solaris.  There is a screenshot in <xref linkend="sect_01_03_02"></xref>.</para>
<para>Almost simultaneously, a couple of other quite famous projects took off.  Also a very common alternative to using MS Office is KOffice, the office suite that used to be popular among SuSE users.  Like the original, this clone incorporates an MS Word and Excel compatible program, and much more.</para>
<para>Smaller projects deal with particular programs of the MS example suite, such as Abiword and MS Wordview for compatibility with MS Word documents, and Gnumeric for viewing and creating Excel compatible spreadsheets.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_06_03_02"><title>Suites and programs</title>
<para>Current distributions usually come with all the necessary tools.  Since these provide excellent guidelines and searchable indexes in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Help</guimenu></menuchoice> menus, we won't discuss them in detail.  For references, see you system documentation or the web sites of the projects, such as</para>

<sect2 id="sect_06_03_03"><title>Remarks</title>
<sect3 id="sect_06_03_03_01"><title>General use of office documents</title>
<para>Try to limit the use of office documents for the purposes they were meant for: the office.</para>
<para>An example: it drives most Linux users crazy if you send them a mail that says in the body something like: <quote>Hello, I want to tell you something, see attach</quote>, and then the attachement proves to be an MS Word compatible document like: <quote>Hello my friend, how is your new job going and will you have time to have lunch with me tomorrow?</quote>  Also a bad idea is the attachment of your signature in such a file, for instance.  If you want to sign messages or files, use GPG, the PGP-compatible GNU Privacy Guard or SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificates.</para>
<para>These users are not annoyed because they are unable to read these documents, or because they are worried that these formats typically generate much larger files, but rather because of the implication that they are using MS Windows, and possibly because of the extra work of starting some additional programs.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_06_03_03_02"><title>System and user configuration files</title>
<para>In the next chapter, we start configuring our environment, and this might include editing all kinds of files that determine how a program behave.</para>
<para><emphasis>Don't edit these files with any office component!</emphasis></para>
<para>The default file format specification  would make the program add several lines of code, defining the format of the file and the fonts used.  These lines won't be interpreted in the correct way by the programs depending on them, resulting in errors or a crash of the program reading the file.  In some cases, you can save the file as plain text, but you'll run into trouble when making this a habit.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_06_03_03_03"><title>But I want a graphical text editor!</title>
<para>If you really insist, try <command>gedit</command>, <command>kedit</command>, <command>kwrite</command> or <command>xedit</command>; these programs only do text files, which is what we will be needing.  If you plan on doing anything serious, though, stick to a real text mode editor such as <command>vim</command> or <command>emacs</command>.</para>
<para>An acceptable alternative is <command>gvim</command>, the Gnome version of <command>vim</command>.  You still need to use <command>vi</command> commands, but if you are stuck, you can look them up in the menus.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect_06_04"><title>Summary</title>
<para>In this chapter we learned to use an editor.  While it depends on your own individual preference which one you use, it is necessary to at least know how to use one editor.</para>
<para>The <command>vi</command> editor is available on every UNIX system.</para>
<para>Most Linux distributions include an office suite and a graphical text editor.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_07_01"><title>General good housekeeping</title>
<sect2 id="sect_07_01_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>As we mentioned before, it is easy enough to make a mess of the system.  We can't put enough stress on the importance of keeping the place tidy.  When you learn this from the start, it will become a good habit that will save you time when programming on a Linux or UNIX system or when confronted with system management tasks.  Here are some ways of making life easier on yourself:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Make a <filename>bin</filename> directory for your program files and scripts.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Organize non-executable files in appropriate directories, and make as many directories as you like.  Examples include separate directories for images, documents, projects, downloaded files, spreadsheets, personal files, and so on.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Make directories private with the <command>chmod <parameter>700</parameter> <filename>dirname</filename></command> command.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Give your files sensible names, such as <filename>Complaint to the prime minister 050302</filename> rather than <filename>letter1</filename>.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_07_01_02"><title>Make space</title>
<para>On some systems, the <command>quota</command> system may force you to clean up from time to time, or the physical limits of your hard disk may force you to make more space without running any monitoring programs.  This section discusses a number of ways, besides using the <command>rm</command> command, to reclaim disk space.</para>
<para>Run the <command>quota <option>-v</option></command> command to see how much space is left.</para>
<sect3 id="sect_07_01_02_01"><title>Emptying files</title>
<para>Sometimes the content of a file doesn't interest you, but you need the file name as a marker (for instance, you just need the timestamp of a file, a reminder that the file was there or should be there some time in the future).  Redirecting the output of a null command is how this is done in the Bourne and Bash shells:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>andy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat wishlist &gt; placeholder</command>

<prompt>andy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -la placeholder</command>
-rw-rw-r--    1 andy   andy       200 Jun 12 13:34 placeholder

<prompt>andy:~&gt;</prompt> <command> &gt; placeholder</command>

<prompt>andy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls -la placeholder</command>

-rw-rw-r--    1 andy   andy         0 Jun 12 13:35 placeholder
</screen>
<para>The process of reducing an existing file to a file with the same name that is 0 bytes large is called <quote>truncating.</quote></para>
<para>For creating a new empty file, the same effect is obtained with the <command>touch</command> command.  On an existing file, <command>touch</command> will only update the timestamp.  See the Info pages on <command>touch</command> for more details.</para>
<para>To <quote>almost</quote> empty a file, use the <command>tail</command> command.  Suppose user <emphasis>andy</emphasis>'s wishlist becomes rather long because he always adds stuff at the end but never deletes the things he actually gets.  Now he only wants to keep the last five items:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>andy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>tail -5 wishlist &gt; newlist</command>

<prompt>andy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat newlist &gt; wishlist</command>

<prompt>andy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>rm newlist</command>
</screen>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_01_02_02"><title>More about log files</title>
<para>Some Linux programs insist on writing all sorts of output in a log file.  Usually there are options to only log errors, or to log a minimal amount of information, for example setting the debugging level of the program.  But even then, you might not care about the log file.  Here are some ways to get rid of them or at least set some limits to their size:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Try removing the log file when the program is not running, if you are sure that you won't need it again.  Some programs may even see, when restarted, that there is no log file and will therefore not log.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>If you remove the log file and the program recreates it, read the documentation for this particular program in search for command options that avoid making log files.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Try making smaller log files by logging only the information that is relevant to you, or by logging only significant information.</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>Try replacing the log file with a symbolic link to <filename>/dev/null</filename>; if you're lucky the program won't complain.  Don't do this with the log files of programs that run at system boot or programs that run from cron (see <xref linkend="chap_04"></xref>).  These programs might replace the symbolic link with a small file that starts growing again.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_01_02_03"><title>Mail</title>
<para>Regularly clean out your mailbox, make sub-folders and automatic redirects using <command>procmail</command> (see the Info pages) or the filters of your favorite mail reading application.  If you have a trash folder, clean it out on a regular basis.</para>
<para>To redirect mail, use the <filename>.forward</filename> file in your home directory.  The Linux mail service looks for this file whenever it has to deliver local mail.  The content of the file defines what the mail system should do with your mail.  It can contain a single line holding a fully qualified E-mail address.  In that case the system will send all your mail to this address.  For instance, when renting space for a website, you might want to forward the mail destined for the webmaster to your own account in order not to waste disk space.  The webmaster's <filename>.forward</filename> may look like this:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>webmaster@www ~/&gt;</prompt> <command>cat .forward</command>
mike@pandora.be
</screen>
<para>Using mail forwarding is also useful to prevent yourself from having to check several different mailboxes.  You can make every address point to a central and easily accessible account.</para>
<para>You can ask your system administrator to define a forward for you in the local mail aliases file, like when an account is being closed but E-mail remains active for a while.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_01_02_04"><title>Save space with a link</title>
<para>When several users need access to the same file or program, when the original file name is too long or too difficult to remember, use a symbolic link instead of a separate copy for each user or purpose.</para>
<para>Multiple symbolic links may have different names, e.g. a link may be called <filename>monfichier</filename> in one user's directory, and <filename>mylink</filename> in another's.  Multiple links (different names) to the same file may also occur in the same directory.  This is often done in the <filename>/lib</filename> directory: when issuing the command</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>ls <option>-l</option> <filename>/lib</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>you will see that this directory is plenty of links pointing to the same files.  These are created so that programs searching for one name would not get stuck, so they are pointed to the correct/current name of the libraries they need.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_01_02_05"><title>Limit file sizes</title>
<para>The shell contains a built-in command to limit file sizes, <command>ulimit</command>, which can also be used to display limitations on system resources:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>cindy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ulimit -a</command>
core file size (blocks)     0
data seg size (kbytes)      unlimited
file size (blocks)          unlimited
max locked memory (kbytes)  unlimited
max memory size (kbytes)    unlimited
open files                  1024
pipe size (512 bytes)       8
stack size (kbytes)         8192
cpu time (seconds)          unlimited
max user processes          512
virtual memory (kbytes)     unlimited
</screen>
<para>Cindy is not a developer and doesn't care about core dumps, which contain debugging information on a program.  If you do want core dumps, you can set their size using the <command>ulimit</command> command.  Read the Info pages on <command>bash</command> for a detailed explanation.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_01_02_06"><title>Compressed files</title>
<para>Compressed files are useful because they take less space on your hard disk.  Another advantage is that it takes less bandwidth to send a compressed file over your network.  A lot of files, such as the man pages, are stored in a compressed format on your system.  Yet unpacking these to get a little bit of information and then having to compress them again is rather time-consuming.  You don't want to unpack a man page, for instance, read about an option to a command and then compress the man page again.  Most people will probably forget to clean up after they found the information they needed.</para>
<para>So we have tools that work on compressed files, by uncompressing them only in memory.  The actual compressed file stays on your disk as it is.  Most systems support <command>zgrep</command>, <command>zcat</command>, <command>bzless</command> and such to prevent unnecessary decompressing/compressing actions.  See your system's binary directory and the Info pages.</para>
<para>See <xref linkend="chap_09"></xref> for more on the actual compressing of files and examples on making archives.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_07_02"><title>Your text environment</title>
<sect2 id="sect_07_02_1"><title>Environment variables</title>
<sect3 id="sect_07_02_01"><title>General</title>
<para>We already mentioned a couple of environment variables, such as <varname>PATH</varname> and <varname>HOME</varname>.  Until now, we only saw examples in which they serve a certain purpose to the shell.  But there are many other Linux utilities that need information about you in order to do a good job.</para>
<para>What other information do programs need apart from paths and home directories?</para>  
<para>A lot of programs want to know about the kind of terminal you are using; this information is stored in the <varname>TERM</varname> variable.  In text mode, this will be the <emphasis>linux</emphasis> terminal emulation, in graphical mode you are likely to use <emphasis>xterm</emphasis>.  Lots of programs want to know what your favorite editor is, in case they have to start an editor in a subprocess.  The shell you are using is stored in the <varname>SHELL</varname> variable, the operating system type in <varname>OS</varname> and so on.  A list of all variables currently defined for your session can be viewed entering the <command>printenv</command> command.</para>
<para>The environment variables are managed by the shell.  As opposed to regular shell variables, environment variables are inherited by any program you start, including another shell.  New processes are assigned a copy of these variables, which they can read, modify and pass on in turn to their own child processes.</para>
<para>There is nothing special about variable names, except that the common ones are in upper case characters by convention.  You may come up with any name you want, although there are standard variables that are important enough to be the same on every Linux system, such as <varname>PATH</varname> and <varname>HOME</varname>.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_02_02"><title>Exporting variables</title>
<para>An individual variable's content is usually displayed using the <command>echo</command> command, as in these examples:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>debby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>echo $PATH</command>
/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin

<prompt>debby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>echo $MANPATH</command>
/usr/man:/usr/share/man/:/usr/local/man:/usr/X11R6/man
</screen>
<para>If you want to change the content of a variable in a way that is useful to other programs, you have to export the new value from your environment into the environment that runs these programs.  A common example is exporting the <varname>PATH</varname> variable.  You may declare it as follows, in order to be able to play with the flight simulator software that is in <filename>/opt/FlightGear/bin</filename>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>debby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>PATH=$PATH:/opt/FlightGear/bin</command>
</screen>
<para>This instructs the shell to not only search programs in the current path, <varname>$PATH</varname>, but also in the additional directory <filename>/opt/FlightGear/bin</filename>.</para>
<para>However, as long as the new value of the <varname>PATH</varname> variable is not known to the environment, things will still not work:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>debby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>runfgfs</command>
bash: runfgfs: command not found
</screen>
<para>Exporting variables is done using the shell built-in command <command>export</command>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>debby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>export PATH</command>

<prompt>debby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>runfgfs</command>
--flight simulator starts--
</screen>
<para>In Bash, we normally do this in one elegant step:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>export <varname>VARIABLE</varname>=<replaceable>value</replaceable></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>The same technique is used for the <varname>MANPATH</varname> variable, that tells the <command>man</command> command where to look for compressed man pages.  If new software is added to the system in new or unusual directories, the documentation for it will probably also be in an unusual directory.  If you want to read the man pages for the new software, extend the <varname>MANPATH</varname> variable:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>debby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>export MANPATH=$MANPATH:/opt/FlightGear/man</command>

<prompt>debby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>echo $MANPATH</command>
/usr/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/local/man:/usr/X11R6/man:/opt/FlightGear/man
</screen>
<para>You can avoid retyping this command in every window you open by adding it to one of your shell setup files, see <xref linkend="sect_07_02_04"></xref>.</para>

<para>A lot of variables are not only predefined but also preset, using configuration files.  We discuss these in the next section.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sect_07_02_04"><title>Shell setup files</title>
<para>When entering the <command>ls <option>-al</option></command> command to get a long listing of all files, including the ones starting with a dot, in your home directory, you will see one or more files starting with a . and ending in <emphasis>rc</emphasis>.  For the case of <command>bash</command>, this is <filename>.bashrc</filename>.  This is the counterpart of the system-wide configuration file <filename>/etc/bashrc</filename>.</para>
<para>When logging into an interactive login shell, <command>login</command> will do the authentication, set the environment and start your shell.  In the case of <command>bash</command>, the next step is reading the general <filename>profile</filename> from <filename>/etc</filename>, if that file exists.  <command>bash</command> then looks for <filename>~/.bash_profile</filename>, <filename>~/.bash_login</filename> and <filename>~/.profile</filename>, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.  If none exists, <filename>/etc/bashrc</filename> is applied.</para>
<para>When a login shell exits, <command>bash</command> reads and executes commands from the file <filename>~/.bash_logout</filename>, if it exists.
</para>
<para>This procedure is explained in detail in the <command>login</command> and <command>bash</command> man pages.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sect_07_02_05"><title>A typical set of setup files</title>
<para>Let's look at some of these config files.  First <filename>/etc/profile</filename> is read, in which important variables such as <varname>PATH</varname>, <varname>USER</varname> and <varname>HOSTNAME</varname> are set:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>debby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat /etc/profile</command>

if ! echo $PATH | /bin/grep -q "/usr/X11R6/bin" ; then
    PATH="$PATH:/usr/X11R6/bin"
fi
</screen>
<para>These lines check the path to set: if <emphasis>root</emphasis> opens a shell (user ID 0), it is checked that <filename>/sbin</filename>, <filename>/usr/sbin</filename> and <filename>/usr/local/sbin</filename> are in the path.  If not, they are added.  It is checked for everyone that <filename>/usr/X11R6/bin</filename> is in the path.</para>

# No core files by default
ulimit -S -c 0 &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

<screen>
if [ -z "$INPUTRC" -a ! -f "$HOME/.inputrc" ]; then
    INPUTRC=/etc/inputrc

</screen>
<para>If the variable <varname>INPUTRC</varname> is not set, and there is no <filename>.inputrc</filename> in the user's home directory, then the default input control file is loaded.  </para>

<para>All readable shell scripts from the <filename>/etc/profile.d</filename> directory are read and executed.  These do things like enabling <emphasis>color-ls</emphasis>, aliasing <command>vi</command> to <command>vim</command>, setting locales etc.  The temporary variable <varname>i</varname> is unset to prevent it from disturbing shell behavior later on.</para>

<para>This very straight forward file instructs your shell to first read <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> and then <filename>~/.bash_login</filename>.  You will encounter the <command>source</command> built-in shell command regularly when working in a shell environment: it is used to apply configuration changes to the current environment.</para>
<para>The <filename>~/.bash_login</filename> file defines default file protection by setting the <command>umask</command> value, see <xref linkend="sect_03_04_02_02"></xref>.  The <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> file is used to define a bunch of user-specific aliases and functions and personal environment variables.  It first reads <filename>/etc/bashrc</filename>, which describes the default prompt (<varname>PS1</varname>) and the default umask value.  After that, you can add your own settings.  If no <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> exists, <filename>/etc/bashrc</filename> is read by default:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>debby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat /etc/bashrc</command>

<sect2 id="sect_07_02_06"><title>The Bash prompt</title>
<sect3 id="sect_07_02_06_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
The Bash prompt can do much more than displaying such simple information as your user name, the name of your machine and some indication about the present working directory.  We can add other information such as the current date and time, number of connected users etc.</para>
<para>Before we begin, however, we will save our current prompt in another environment variable:
</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[jerry@nowhere jerry]$</prompt> <command>MYPROMPT=$PS1</command>

<prompt>[jerry@nowhere jerry]$</prompt> <command>echo $MYPROMPT</command>
[\u@\h \W]\$

<prompt>[jerry@nowhere jerry]$</prompt>
</screen>
<para>When we change the prompt now, for example by issuing the command <command><varname>PS1</varname>=<replaceable>"-&gt;"</replaceable></command>, we can always get our original prompt back with the command <command><varname>PS1</varname>=<varname>$MYPROMPT</varname></command>.  You will, of course, also get it back when you reconnect, as long as you just fiddle with the prompt on the command line and avoid putting it in a shell configuration file.</para>

<para>Variables are exported so the subsequently executed commands will also know about the environment.  The prompt configuration line that you want is best put in your shell configuration file, <filename>~/.bashrc</filename>.</para>
<para>If you want, prompts can execute shell scripts and behave different under different conditions.  You can even have the prompt play a tune every time you issue a command, although this gets boring pretty soon.

<sect2 id="sect_07_02_07"><title>Shell scripts</title>
<sect3 id="sect_07_02_07_01"><title>What are scripts?</title>
<para>A shell script is, as we saw in the shell configuration examples, a text file containing shell commands.  When such a file is used as the first non-option argument when invoking Bash, and neither the `-c' nor `-s' option is supplied, Bash reads and executes commands from the file, then exits.  This mode of operation creates a non-interactive shell.  When Bash runs a shell script, it sets the special parameter `0' to the name of the file, rather than the name of the shell, and the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments, if any are given.  If no additional arguments are supplied, the positional parameters are unset.</para>
<para>A shell script may be made executable by using the <command>chmod</command> command to turn on the execute bit.  When Bash finds such a file while searching the <varname>PATH</varname> for a command, it spawns a sub-shell to execute it.  In other words, executing</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>filename <parameter>ARGUMENTS</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>is equivalent to executing</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>bash <parameter>filename</parameter> <parameter>ARGUMENTS</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>if `filename' is an executable shell script.  This sub-shell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a new shell had been invoked to interpret the script, with the exception that the locations of commands remembered by the parent (see <command>hash</command> in the Info pages) are retained by the child.</para>
<para>Most versions of UNIX make this a part of the operating system's command execution mechanism.  If the first line of a script begins with the two characters `#!', the remainder of the line specifies an interpreter for the program.  Thus, you can specify <command>bash</command>, <command>awk</command>, <command>perl</command> or some other interpreter or shell and write the rest of the script file in that language.</para>
<para>The arguments to the interpreter consist of a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the first line of the script file, followed by the name of the script file, followed by the rest of the arguments.  Bash will perform this action on operating systems that do not handle it themselves.</para>
<para>Bash scripts often begin with `#! /bin/bash' (assuming that Bash has been installed in `/bin'), since this ensures that Bash will be used to interpret the script, even if it is executed under another shell.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_02_07_02"><title>Some simple examples</title>
<para>A very simple script consisting of only one command, that says hello to the user executing it:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[jerry@nowhere ~]</prompt> <command>cat hello.sh</command>
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello $USER"
</screen>
<para>The script actually consists of only one command, <command>echo</command>, which uses the <emphasis>value of</emphasis> ($) the <varname>USER</varname> environment variable to print a string customized to the user issuing the command.</para>
<para>Another one-liner, used for displaying connected users:</para>
<screen>
#!/bin/bash
who | cut -d " " -f 1 | sort -u
</screen>
<para>Here is a script consisting of some more lines, that I use to make backup copies of all files in a directory.  
The script first makes a list of all the files in the current directory and puts it in the variable <varname>LIST</varname>.  Then it sets the name of the copy for each file, and then it copies the file.  For each file, a message is printed:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>tille:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cat <filename>bin/makebackupfiles.sh</filename></command>
#!/bin/bash
# make copies of all files in a directory
LIST=`ls`
for i in $LIST; do
	ORIG=$i
	DEST=$i.old
	cp $ORIG $DEST
	echo "copied $i"
done
</screen>
<para>Just entering a line like <command>mv <parameter>*</parameter> <parameter>*.old</parameter></command> won't work, as you will notice when trying this on a set of test files.  An <command>echo</command> command was added in order to display some activity.  <command>echo</command>'s are generally useful when a script won't work: insert one after each doubted step and you will find the error in no time.</para>
<para>The <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d</filename> directory contains loads of examples.  Let's look at this script that controls the fictive ICanSeeYou server:</para>
<screen>
#!/bin/sh
# description: ICanSeeYou allows you to see networked people

# process name: ICanSeeYou
# pidfile: /var/run/ICanSeeYou/ICanSeeYou.pid
# config: /etc/ICanSeeYou.cfg

# Source function library.
. /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions

# See how (with which arguments) we were called.
case "$1" in
	start)
		echo -n "Starting ICanSeeYou: "
		daemon ICanSeeYou
		echo
		touch /var/lock/subsys/ICanSeeYou
		;;
	stop)
		echo -n "Shutting down ICanSeeYou: "
		killproc ICanSeeYou
		echo
		rm -f /var/lock/subsys/ICanSeeYou
		rm -f /var/run/ICanSeeYou/ICanSeeYou.pid
		;;
	status)
		status ICanSeeYou
		;;
	restart)
		$0 stop
		$0 start
		;;
	*)
		echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart|status}"
		exit 1
esac

exit 0
</screen>
<para>First, with the <command>.</command> command (dot) a set of shell functions, used by almost all shell scripts in <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d</filename>, is loaded.  Then a <command>case</command> command is issued, which defines 4 different ways the script can execute.  An example might be <command>ICanSeeYou <parameter>start</parameter></command>.  The decision of which case to apply is made by reading the (first) argument to the script, with the expression <emphasis>$1</emphasis>.</para>
<para>When no compliant input is given, the default case, marked with an asterisk, is applied, upon which the script gives an error message.  The <command>case</command> list is ended with the <command>esac</command> statement.  In the <emphasis>start</emphasis> case the server program is started as a daemon, and a process ID and lock are assigned.  In the <emphasis>stop</emphasis> case, the server process is traced down and stopped, and the lock and the PID are removed.  Options, such as the <option>daemon</option> option, and functions like <option>killproc</option>, are defined in the <filename>/etc/rc.d/init.d/functions</filename> file.  This setup is specific to the distribution used in this example.  The initscripts on your system might use other functions, defined in other files, or none at all.</para>
<para>Upon success, the script returns an exit code of zero to its parent.</para>
<para>
This script is a fine example of using functions, which make the script easier to read and the work done faster.  Note that they use <command>sh</command> instead of <command>bash</command>, to make them useful on a wider range of systems.  On a Linux system, calling <command>bash</command> as <command>sh</command> results in the shell running in POSIX-compliant mode.</para>

<para>The <command>bash</command> man pages contain more information about combining commands, for- and while-loops and regular expressions, as well as examples.  A comprehensible Bash course for system administrators and power users, with exercises, from the same author as this Introduction to Linux guide, is at <ulink url="training/bash/">http://tille.xalasys.com/training/bash/</ulink>.  Detailed description of Bash features and applications is in the reference guide <ulink url="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html">Advanced Bash Scripting</ulink>.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_07_03_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>The average user may not care too much about his login settings, but Linux offers a wide variety of flashy window and desktop managers for use under X, the graphical environment.  The use and configuration of window managers and desktops is straightforward and may even resemble the standard MS Windows, MacIntosh or UNIX CDE environment, although many Linux users prefer flashier desktops and fancier window managers.  We won't discuss the user specific configuration here.  Just experiment and read the documentation using the built-in Help functions these managers provide and you will get along fine.</para>
<para>We will, however, take a closer look at the underlying system.</para>


</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_07_03_02"><title>The X Window System</title>
<para>The X Window System is a network-transparent window system which runs on a wide range of computing and graphics machines.  X Window System servers run on computers with bitmap displays.  The X server distributes user input to and accepts output requests from several client programs through a variety of different interprocess communication channels.  Although the most common case is for the client programs to be running on the same machine as the server, clients can be run transparently from other machines (including machines with different architectures and operating systems) as well.  We will learn how to do this in <xref linkend="chap_10"></xref> on networking and remote applications.</para>
<para>X supports overlapping hierarchical sub-windows and text and graphics operations, on both monochrome and color displays.  The number of X client programs that use the X server is quite large.  Some of the programs provided in the core X Consortium distribution include:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><command>xterm</command>: a terminal emulator</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>twm</command>: a minimalistic window manager</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>xdm</command>: a display manager</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>xconsole</command>: a console redirect program</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>bitmap</command>: a bitmap editor</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>xauth</command>, <command>xhost</command> and <command>iceauth</command>: access control programs</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>xset</command>, <command>xmodmap</command> and many others: user preference setting programs</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>xclock</command>: a clock</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>xlsfonts</command> and others: a font displayer, utilities for listing information about fonts, windows and displays</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>xfs</command>: a font server</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>...</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>We refer again to the man pages of these commands for detailed information.  More explanations on available functions can be found in the <emphasis>Xlib - C language X Interface</emphasis> manual that comes with your X distribution, the <emphasis>X Window System Protocol</emphasis> specification, and the various manuals and documentation of X toolkits.  The <filename>/usr/share/doc</filename> directory contains references to these documents and many others.</para>
<para>Many other utilities, window managers, games, toolkits and gadgets are included as user-contributed software in the X Consortium distribution, or are available using anonymous FTP on the Internet.  Good places to start are <ulink url="http://www.x.org">http://www.x.org</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.xfree.org">http://www.xfree.org</ulink>.</para>
<para>Furthermore, all your graphical applications, such as your browser, your E-mail program, your image viewing programs, sound playing tools and so on, are all clients to your X server.  Note that in normal operation, that is in graphical mode, X clients and the X server on Linux run on the same machine.</para>
<sect3 id="sect_07_03_02_01"><title>Display names</title>
<para>From the user's perspective, every X server has a <emphasis>display name</emphasis> in the form of:</para> 
<cmdsynopsis><command><parameter>hostname</parameter>:<parameter>displaynumber</parameter>.<parameter>screennumber</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>This information is used by the application to determine how it should connect to the X server and which screen it should use by default (on displays with multiple monitors):</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis>hostname</emphasis>: The host name specifies the name of the client machine to which the display is physically connected.  If the host name is not given, the most efficient way of communicating to a server on the same machine will be used.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>displaynumber</emphasis>: The phrase <quote>display</quote> is usually used to refer to a collection of monitors that share a common key board and pointer (mouse, tablet, etc.).  Most workstations  tend  to only have one keyboard, and therefore, only one display.  Larger, multi-user systems, however, frequently have several displays so that more than one person can be doing graphics work at once.  To avoid confusion, each display on a machine is assigned a <emphasis>display number</emphasis> (beginning at 0) when the X server for that display is started.  The display number must always be given in a display name.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>screen number</emphasis>: Some displays share a single keyboard and pointer among two or more monitors.  Since each monitor has its own set of windows, each screen is assigned a <emphasis>screen number</emphasis> (beginning at 0) when the X server for that display is started.  If the screen number is not given, screen 0 will be used.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>On POSIX systems, the default display name is stored in your <varname>DISPLAY</varname> environment variable.  This variable is set automatically by the <command>xterm</command> terminal emulator.  However, when you log into another machine on a network, you might need to set <varname>DISPLAY</varname> by hand to point to your display, see <xref linkend="sect_10_03_03"></xref>.</para>
<para>More information can be found in the X man pages.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_03_02_02"><title>Window and desktop managers</title>
<para>The layout of windows on the screen is controlled by special programs called <emphasis>window managers</emphasis>.  Although many window managers will honor geometry specifications as given, others may choose to ignore them (requiring the user to explicitly draw the window's region on the screen with the pointer, for example).</para>
<para>Since window managers are regular (albeit complex) client programs, a variety of different user interfaces can be built.  The X Consortium distribution comes with a window manager named <command>twm</command>, but most users prefer something more fancy when system resources permit.  Sawfish and Enlightenment are popular examples which allow each user to have a desktop according to mood and style.</para>
<para>A desktop manager makes use of one window manager or another for arranging your graphical desktop in a convenient way, with menubars, drop-down menus, informative messages, a clock, a program manager, a file manager and so on.  Among the most popular desktop managers are Gnome and KDE, which both run on almost any Linux distribution and many other UNIX systems.</para>
<tip><title>KDE applications in Gnome/Gnome applications in KDE</title>
<para>You don't need to start your desktop in KDE in order to be able to run KDE applications.  If you have the KDE libraries installed (the <application>kdelibs</application> package), you can run these applications from the Gnome menus or start them from a Gnome terminal.</para>
<para>Running Gnome applications in a KDE environment is a bit more tricky, because there is no single set of base-libraries in Gnome.  However, the dependencies and thus extra packages you might have to install will become clear when running or installing such an application.</para>
</tip> 

</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_07_03_03"><title>X server configuration</title>
<para>The X distribution that used to come with Linux, <emphasis>XFree86</emphasis>, uses the configuration file <filename>XF86Config</filename> for its initial setup.  This file configures your video card and is searched for in a number of locations, although it is usually in <filename>/etc/X11</filename>.</para>
<para>If you see that the file <filename>/etc/X11/XF86Config</filename> is present on your system, a full description can be found in the Info or man pages about <filename>XF86Config</filename>.</para>
<para>Because of licensing issues with XFree86, newer systems usually come with the <emphasis>X.Org</emphasis> distribution of the X server and tools.  The main configuration file here is <filename>xorg.conf</filename>, usually also in <filename>/etc/X11</filename>.  The file consists of a number of sections that may occur in any order.  The sections contain information about your monitor, your video adaptor, the screen configuration, your keyboard etcetera.  As a user, you needn't worry too much about what is in this file, since everything is normally determined at the time the system is installed.</para>
<para>Should you need to change graphical server settings, however, you can run the configuration tools or edit the configuration files that set up the infrastructure to use the XFree86 server.  See the man pages for more information; your distribution might have its own tools.  Since misconfiguration may result in unreadable garbage in graphical mode, you may want to make a backup copy of the configuration file before attempting to change it, just to be on the safe side.</para>
</sect2>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect_07_05"><title>Region specific settings</title>
<sect2 id="sect_07_05_01"><title>Keyboard setup</title>
<para>Setting the keyboard layout is done using the <command>loadkeys</command> command for text consoles.  Use your local X configuration tool or edit the <emphasis>Keyboard</emphasis> section in <filename>XF86Config</filename> manually to configure the layout for graphical mode.  The <varname>XkbdLayout</varname> is the one you want to set:</para>
<screen>
    XkbLayout       "us"
</screen>
<para>This is the default.  Change it to your local settings by replacing the quoted value with any of the names listed in the subdirectories of your <filename>keymaps</filename> directory.  If you can't find the keymaps, try displaying their location on your system issuing the command</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>locate <filename>keymaps</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>It is possible to combine layout settings, like in this example:</para>
<screen>
Xkblayout      "us,ru"
</screen>
<para>Make a backup of the <filename>/etc/X11/XF86Config</filename> file before editing it!  You will need to use the <emphasis>root</emphasis> account to do this.</para>
<para>Log out and reconnect in order to reload X settings.</para>
<para>The <application>Gnome Keyboard Applet</application> enables real-time switching between layouts; no special pemissions are needed for using this program.  KDE has a similar tool for switching between keyboard layouts.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_07_05_02"><title>Fonts</title>
<para>Use the <command>setfont</command> tool to load fonts in text mode.  Most systems come with a standard <filename>inputrc</filename> file which enables combining of characters, such as the French <quote>é</quote> (meta characters).  The system admin should then add the line</para>
<screen>
export INPUTRC="/etc/inputrc"
</screen>
<para>to the <filename>/etc/bashrc</filename> file.</para>  

</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_07_05_03"><title>Date and time zone</title>
<para>Setting time information is usually done at installation time.  After that, it can be kept up to date using an <emphasis>NTP</emphasis> (Network Time Protocol) client.  Most Linux systems run <command>ntpd</command> by default:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>debby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ps -ef | grep ntpd</command>
ntp      24678     1  0  2002 ?        00:00:33 ntpd -U ntp
</screen>
<para>See your system manual and the documentation that comes with the NTP package.  Most desktop managers include tools to set the system time, providing that you have access to the system administrator's account.</para>
<para>For setting the time zone correct, you can use <command>tzconfig</command> or <command>timezone</command> commands.  Timezone information is usually set during the installation of your machine.  Many systems have distribution-specific tools to configure it, see your system documentation.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_07_05_04"><title>Language</title>
<para>If you'd rather get your messages from the system in Dutch or French, you may want to set the <varname>LANG</varname> and <varname>LANGUAGE</varname> environment variables, thus enabling locale support for the desired language and eventually the fonts related to character conventions in that language.</para>
<para>With most graphical login systems, such as <command>gdm</command> or <command>kdm</command>, you have the possibility to configure these language settings before logging in.</para>
<para>Note that on most systems, the default tends to be <emphasis>en_US.UTF-8</emphasis> these days.  This is not a problem, because systems where this is the default, will also come with all the programs supporting this encoding.  Thus, <command>vi</command> can edit all the files on your system, <command>cat</command> won't behave strange and so on.</para>
<para>Trouble starts when you connect to an older system not supporting this font encoding, or when you open a <emphasis>UTF-8</emphasis> encoded file on a system supporting only 1-byte character fonts.  The <command>recode</command> utility might come in handy to convert files from one character set to another.  Read the man pages for an overview of features and usage.  Another solution might be to temporarily work with another encoding definition, by setting the <varname>LANG</varname> environment variable:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>debby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>acroread /var/tmp/51434s.pdf</command>
Warning: charset "UTF-8" not supported, using "ISO8859-1".

<sect1 id="sect_07_06"><title>Installing new software</title>
<sect2 id="sect_07_06_01"><title>General</title>
<para>Most people are surprised to see that they have a running, usable computer after installing Linux; most distributions contain ample support for video and network cards, monitors and other external devices, so there is usually no need to install extra drivers.  Also common tools such as office suites, web browsers, E-mail clients and such are included in the main distributions.  Even so, an initial installation might not meet your requirements.</para>
<para>If you just can't find what you need, maybe it is not installed on your system.  It may also be that you have the required software, but it does not do what it is supposed to do.  Remember that Linux moves fast, and software improves on a daily basis.  Don't waste your time troubleshooting problems that might already be resolved.</para>
<para>You can update your system or add packages to it at any time you want.  Most software comes in packages.  Extra software may be found on your installation CDs or on the Internet.  The website of your Linux distribution is a good place to start looking for additional software and contains instructions about how to install it on your type of Linux, see <xref linkend="app1"></xref>.  Always read the documentation that comes with new software, and any installation guidelines the package might contain.  All software comes with a <filename>README</filename> file, which you are very strongly advised to read.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sect_07_06_02"><title>Package formats</title>
<sect3 id="sect_07_06_02_01"><title>RPM packages</title>
<para>RPM, the RedHat Package Manager, is a powerful package manager that you can use to install, update and remove packages.  It allows you to search for packages and keeps track of the files that come with each package.  A system is built-in so that you can verify the authenticity of packages downloaded from the Internet.  Advanced users can build their own packages with RPM.</para>
<para>An RPM package  consists  of an archive of files and meta-data used to install and erase the archive files. The meta-data includes  helper  scripts,  file attributes,  and  descriptive  information about the package.  Packages come in two varieties: binary packages, used to encapsulate software to be  installed,  and source  packages,  containing  the source code and recipe necessary to produce binary packages.</para>
<para>Many other distributions support RPM packages, among the popular ones RedHat Enterprise Linux, Mandriva (former Mandrake), Fedora Core and SuSE Linux.  Apart from the advice for your distribution, you will want to read <command>man <parameter>rpm</parameter></command>.</para>
<para>Most packages are simply installed with the upgrade option, <option>-U</option>, whether the package is already installed or not.  The RPM package contains a complete version of the program, which overwrites existing versions or installs as a new package.  The typical usage is as follows:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>rpm <option>-Uvh</option> <filename>/path/to/rpm-package(s)</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>The <option>-v</option> option generates more verbose output, and <option>-h</option> makes <command>rpm</command> print a progress bar:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[root@jupiter tmp]#</prompt> <command>rpm -Uvh totem-0.99.5-1.fr.i386.rpm</command>
Preparing...                ########################################### [100%]
   1:totem                  ########################################### [100%]
<prompt>[root@jupiter tmp]#</prompt>
</screen>
<para>New kernel packages, however, are installed with the install option <option>-i</option>, which does not overwrite existing version(s) of the package. That way, you will still be able to boot your system with the old kernel if the new one does not work.</para>
<para>You can also use <command>rpm</command> to check whether a package is installed on your system:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[david@jupiter ~]</prompt> <command>rpm -qa | grep vim</command>
vim-minimal-6.1-29
vim-X11-6.1-29
vim-enhanced-6.1-29
vim-common-6.1-29
</screen> 
<para>Or you can find out which package contains a certain file or executable:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[david@jupiter ~]</prompt> <command>rpm -qf /etc/profile</command>
setup-2.5.25-1

<prompt>[david@jupiter ~]</prompt> <command>which cat</command>
cat is /bin/cat

<prompt>[david@jupiter ~]</prompt> <command>rpm -qf /bin/cat</command>
coreutils-4.5.3-19
</screen>
<para>Note that you need not have access to administrative privileges in order to use <command>rpm</command> to query the RPM database.  You only need to be <emphasis>root</emphasis> when adding, modifying or deleting packages.</para>
<para>Below is one last example, demonstrating how to uninstall a package using <command>rpm</command>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[root@jupiter root]#</prompt> <command>rpm -e totem</command>
<prompt>[root@jupiter root]#</prompt>
</screen>
<para>Note that uninstalling is not that verbose by default, it is normal that you don't see much happening.  When in doubt, use <command>rpm <option>-qa</option></command> again to verify that the package has been removed.</para>
<para>RPM can do much more than the couple of basic functions we discussed in this introduction; the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/RPM-HOWTO/index.html">RPM HOWTO</ulink> contains further references.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_06_02_02"><title>DEB (.deb) packages</title>
<para>This package format is the default on Debian GNU/Linux, where <command>dselect</command>, and, nowadays more common, <command>aptitude</command>, is the standard tool for managing the packages.  It is used to select packages that you want to install or upgrade, but it will also run during the installation of a Debian system and help you to define the access method to use, to list available packages and to configure packages.</para>
<para>The <ulink url="http://debian.org">Debian web site</ulink> contains all information you need, including a <quote>dselect Documentation for Beginners</quote>.</para>
<para>According to the latest news, the Debian package format is becoming more and more popular.  At the time of this writing, 5 of the top-10 distributions use it.  Also <command>apt-get</command> (see <xref linkend="sect_07_06_03_02"></xref> is becoming extremely popular, also on non-DEB systems.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_06_02_03"><title>Source packages</title>
<para>The largest part of Linux programs is Free/Open Source, so source packages are available for these programs.  Source files are needed for compiling your own program version.  Sources for a program can be downloaded from its web site, often as a compressed tarball (<filename>program-version.tar.gz</filename> or similar). For RPM-based distributions, the source is often provided in the <filename>program-version.src.rpm</filename>.  Debian, and most distributions based on it, provide themselves the adapted source which can be obtained using <command>apt-get <parameter>source</parameter></command>.</para>
<para>Specific requirements, dependencies and installation instructions are provided in the <filename>README</filename> file.  You will probably need a C compiler, <command>gcc</command>.  This GNU C compiler is included in most Linux systems and is ported to many other platforms.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_07_06_03"><title>Automating package management and updates</title>
<sect3 id="sect_07_06_03_01"><title>General remarks</title>
<para>The first thing you do after installing a new system is applying updates;
this applies to all operating systems and Linux is not different.</para>
<para>The updates for most Linux systems can usually be found on a nearby site mirroring your distribution.  Lists of sites offering this service can be found at your distribution's web site, see <xref linkend="app1"></xref>.</para>
<para>Updates should be applied regularly, daily if possible - but every couple of weeks would be a reasonable start.  You really should try to have the most recent version of your distribution, since Linux changes constantly.  As we said before, new features, improvements and bug fixes are supplied at a steady rhythm, and sometimes important security problems are addressed.</para>
<para>The good news is that most Linux distributions provide tools so that you don't have to upgrade tens of packages daily by hand.  The following sections give an overview of <quote>package manager managers.</quote>  There is much more to this subject, even regular updates of source packages is manageable automatically; we only list the most commonly known systems.  Always refer to the documentation for your specific distribution for advised procedures.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_06_03_02"><title>APT</title>
<para>The Advanced Package Tool is a management system for software packages.  The command line tool for handling packages is <command>apt-get</command>, which comes with an excellent man page describing how to install and update packages and how to upgrade singular packages or your entire distribution.  APT has its roots in the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, where it is the default manager for the Debian packages.  APT has been ported to work with RPM packages as well.  The main advantage of APT is that it is free and flexible to use.  It will allow you to set up systems similar to the distribution specific (and in some cases commercial) ones listed in the next sections.</para>
<para>Generally, when first using <command>apt-get</command>, you will need to get an index of the available packages.  This is done using the command</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>apt-get <parameter>update</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>After that, you can use <command>apt-get</command> to upgrade your system:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>apt-get <parameter>upgrade</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>Do this often, it's an easy way to keep your system up-to-date and thus safe.</para>
<para>Apart from this general usage, <command>apt-get</command> is also very fast for installing individual packages.  This is how it works:</para>

<para><application>Update Agent</application>, which originally only supported RedHat RPM packages, is now ported to a wider set of software, including non-RedHat repositories.  This tool provides a complete system for updating the RPM packages on a RedHat or Fedora Core system.  On the command line, type <command>up2date</command> to update your system.  On the desktop, by default a small icon is activated, telleng you whether or not there are updates available for your system.</para>
<para><application>Yellowdog's Updater Modified</application> (<command>yum</command>) is another tool that recently became more popular.  It is an interactive but automated update program for installing, updating or removing RPM packages on a system.  It is the tool of choice on Fedora systems.</para>
<para>On SuSE Linux, everything is done with <application>YaST</application>, Yet another Setup Tool, which supports a wide variety of system administration tasks, among which updating RPM packages.  Starting from SuSE Linux 7.1 you can also upgrade using a web interface and <application>YOU</application>, Yast Online Update.</para>
<para>Mandrake Linux and Mandriva provide so-called URPMI tools, a set of wrapper programs that make installing new software easier for the user.  These tools combine with <application>RPMDrake</application> and <application>MandrakeUpdate</application> to provide everything needed for smooth install and uninstall of software packages.  MandrakeOnline offers an extended range of services and can automatically notify administrators when updates are available for your particular Mandrake system.  See <command>man <parameter>urpmi</parameter></command>, among others, for more info.</para>
<para>Also the KDE and Gnome desktop suites have their own (graphical) versions of package managers.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_07_06_04"><title>Upgrading your kernel</title>
<para>Most Linux installations are fine if you periodically upgrade your distribution.  The upgrade procedure will install a new kernel when needed and make all necessary changes to your system.  You should only compile or install a new kernel manually if you need kernel features that are not supported by the default kernel included in your Linux distribution.</para>
<para>Whether compiling your own optimized kernel or using a pre-compiled kernel package, install it in co-existence with the old kernel until you are sure that everything works according to plan.</para>
<para>Then create a dual boot system that will allow you to choose which kernel to boot by updating your boot loader configuration file <filename>grub.conf</filename>.  This is a simple example:</para>
<screen>
# grub.conf generated by anaconda
#
# Note that you do not have to rerun grub after making config changes. 
# NOTICE:  You have a /boot partition.  This means that
#          all kernel and initrd paths are relative to /boot/, e.g.
#          root (hd0,0)
#          kernel /vmlinuz-version ro root=/dev/hde8
#          initrd /initrd-version.img
#boot=/dev/hde
default=0
timeout=10
splashimage=(hd0,0)/grub/splash.xpm.gz
title Red Hat Linux new (2.4.9-31)
	root (hd0,0)
	kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.9-31 ro root=/dev/hde8
	initrd /initrd-2.4.9-31.img
title old-kernel
        root (hd0,0)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.4.9-21 ro root=/dev/hde8
        initrd /initrd-2.4.9-21.img
</screen>
<para>After the new kernel has proven to work, you may remove the lines for the old one from the GRUB config file, although it is best to wait a couple of days just to be sure.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_07_06_05"><title>Installing extra packages from the installation CDs</title>
<sect3 id="sect_07_06_05_01"><title>Mounting a CD</title>
<para>This is basically done in the same way as installing packages manually, except that you have to append the file system of the CD to your machine's file system to make it accessible.  On most systems, this will be done automatically upon insertion of a CD in the drive because the <command>automount</command> daemon is started up at boot time.  If your CD is not made available automatically, issue the <command>mount</command> command in a terminal window.  Depending on your actual system configuration, a line similar to this one will usually do the trick:</para>
<para><cmdsynopsis><command>mount <filename>/dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom</filename></command></cmdsynopsis></para>
<para>On some systems, only <emphasis>root</emphasis> can mount removable media; this depends on the configuration.</para>
<para>For automation purposes, the CD drive usually has an entry in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>, which lists the file systems and their mount points, that make up your file system tree.  This is such a line:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[david@jupiter ~]</prompt> <command>grep cdrom /etc/fstab</command>
/dev/cdrom	/mnt/cdrom	iso9660		noauto,owner,ro 0 0
</screen>
<para>This indicates that the system will understand the command <command>mount <filename>/mnt/cdrom</filename></command>.  The <option>noauto</option> option means that on this system, CDs are not mounted at boot time.</para>
<para>You may even try to right click on the CD icon on your desktop to mount the CD if your file manager doesn't do it for you.  You can check whether it worked issuing the <command>mount</command> command with no arguments:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[david@jupiter ~]</prompt> <command>mount | grep cdrom</command>
/dev/cdrom on /mnt/cdrom type iso9660 (ro,nosuid,nodev)
</screen>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_06_05_02"><title>Using the CD</title>
<para>After mounting the CD, you can change directories, usually to the mount point <filename>/mnt/cdrom</filename>, where you can access the content of the CD-ROM.  Use the same commands for dealing with files and directories as you would use for files on the hard disk.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_07_06_05_03"><title>Ejecting the CD</title>
<para>In order to get the CD out of the drive after you've finished using it, the file system on the CD should be unused.  Even being in one of the subdirectories of the mount point, <filename>/mnt/cdrom</filename> in our example, will be considered as <quote>using the file system</quote>, so you should get out of there.  Do this for instance by typing <command>cd</command> with no arguments, which will put you back in your home directory.  After that, you can either use the command</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>umount <filename>/mnt/cdrom</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>or</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>eject <parameter>cdrom</parameter></command></cmdsynopsis>
<warning><title>Blocked drives</title>
<para><emphasis>NEVER</emphasis> force the drive.  The trick with the paperclip is a bad idea, because this will eventually expunge the CD, but your system will think the CD is still there because normal procedures were not followed.  Chances are likely that you will have to reboot to get the system back in a consistent state.</para>
<para>If you keep getting <quote>device busy</quote> messages, check first that all shell sessions have left the CD file system and that no graphical applications are using it anymore.  When in doubt, use the <command>lsof</command> tool to trace down the process(es) still using the CD resource.</para>

<para>When everything has its place, that means already half the work is done.</para>
<para>While keeping order is important, it is equally important to feel at home in your environment, whether text or graphical.  The text environment is controlled through the shell setup files.  The graphical environment is primarily dependent on the X server configuration, on which a number of other applications are built, such as window and desktop managers and graphical applications, each with their own config files.  You should read the system and program specific documentation to find out about how to configure them.</para>
<para>Regional settings such as keyboard setup, installing appropriate fonts and language support are best done at installation time.</para>

<note><title>Why are there two commands for every task related to printing?</title>
<para>Printing on UNIX and alikes has a long history.  There used to be two rather different approaches: the BSD-style printing and the SystemV-style printing.  For compatibility, Linux with CUPS supports the commands from both styles.  Also note that <command>lp</command> does not behave exactly like <command>lpr</command>, <command>lpq</command> has somewhat different options than <command>lpstat</command> and <command>lprm</command> is almost, but not quite, like <command>cancel</command>.  Which one you use is not important, just pick the commands that you are comfortable with, or that you may know from previous experiences with UNIX-like systems.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_08_01_02"><title>Formatting</title>
<sect3 id="sect_08_01_02_01"><title>Tools and languages</title>
<para>If we want to get something sensible out of the printer, files should be formatted first.  Apart from an abundance of formatting software, Linux comes with the basic UNIX formatting tools and languages.</para>
<para>Modern Linux systems support direct printing, without any formatting by the user, of a range of file types: text, PDF, PostScript and several image formats like PNG, JPEG, BMP and GIF.</para>

<para>For those file formats that do need formatting, Linux comes with a lot of formatting tools, such as the <command>pdf2ps</command>, <command>fax2ps</command> and <command>a2ps</command> commands, that convert other formats to PostScript.</para>
<para>Apart from these command line tools there are a lot of graphical word processing programs.  Several complete office suites are available, many are free.  These do the formatting automatically upon submission of a print job.  Just to name a few: OpenOffice, KOffice, AbiWord, WordPerfect, etc.</para>



<para>The following are common languages in a printing context:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><command>groff</command>: GNU version of the UNIX <command>roff</command> command.  It is a front-end to the groff document formatting system.  Normally it runs the <command>troff</command> command and a post-processor appropriate for the selected device.  It allows generation of PostScript files.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis>TeX</emphasis> and the macro package <emphasis>LaTeX</emphasis>: one of the most widely used markup languages on UNIX systems.  Usually invoked as <command>tex</command>, it formats files and outputs a corresponding device-independent representation of the typeset document.</para>
<para>Technical works are <emphasis>still</emphasis> frequently written in LaTeX because of its support for mathematic formulas, although efforts are being made at <ulink url="http://www.w3.org">W3C</ulink> (the World Wide Web Consortium) to include this feature in other applications.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>SGML and XML: Free parsers are available for UNIX and Linux.  XML is the next generation SGML, it forms the basis for DocBook XML, a document system (this book is written in XML, for instance).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>


<tip><title>Printing documentation</title>
<para>The man pages contain pre-formatted <command>troff</command> data which has to be formatted before it can roll out of your printer.  Printing is done using the <option>-t</option> option to the <command>man</command> command:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>man <option>-t</option> <parameter>command</parameter> &gt; <filename>man-command.ps</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>Then print the PostScript file.  If a default print destination is configured for your system/account, you can just issue the command <command>man <option>-t</option> <parameter>command</parameter></command> to send the formatted page to the printer directly.</para><para>For printing Info pages, refer to the Info pages on <command>info</command> (you will need the source code of the command).</para></tip>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_08_01_02_02"><title>Previewing formatted files</title>
<para>Anything that you can send to the printer can normally be sent to the screen as well.  Depending on the file format, you can use one of these commands:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>PostScript files: with the <command>gv</command> (GhostView) command.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>TeX dvi files: with <command>xdvi</command>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>PDF files: <command>xpdf</command> or Adobe's viewer, <command>acroread</command>, which is also available for free.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>From within applications, such as Firefox or OpenOffice, you can usually select <menuchoice><guimenu>Print Preview</guimenu></menuchoice> from one of the menus.</para></listitem>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect_08_02"><title>The server side</title>
<sect2 id="sect_08_02_01"><title>General</title>
<para>Until a couple of years ago, the choice for Linux users was simple:  everyone ran the same old LPD from BSD's Net-2 code.  Then LPRng became more popular, but nowadays most modern Linux distributions use <ulink url="http://www.cups.org">CUPS</ulink>, the Common UNIX Printing System.  <application>CUPS</application> is an implementation of the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), an HTTP-like RFC standard replacement protocol for the venerable (and clunky) LPD protocol.  CUPS is distributed under the GNU Public License.  CUPS is also the default print system on MacOS X.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_08_02_02"><title>Graphical printer configuartion</title>
<para>Most distributions come with a GUI for configuring networked and local (parallel port or USB) printers.  They let you choose the printer type from a list and allow easy testing.  You don't have to bother about syntax and location of configuration files.  Check your system documentation before you attempt installing your printer.</para>
<para>CUPS can also be configured using a web interface that runs on port 631 on your computer.  To check if this feature is enabled, try browsing to <ulink url="localhost:631/help"></ulink>.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_08_02_04"><title>Buying a printer for Linux</title>
<para>As more and more printer vendors make drivers for CUPS available, CUPS will allow easy connection with almost any printer that you can plug into a serial, parallel, or USB port, plus any printer on the network.  CUPS will ensure a uniform presentation to you and your applications of all different types of printers.</para>
<para>Printers that only come with a Win9x driver could be problematic if they have no other support.  Check with the hardware compatibility HOWTO when in doubt.</para>
<para>In the past, your best choice would have been a printer with native PostScript support in the firmware, since nearly all UNIX or Linux software producing printable output, produces it in PostScript, the publishing industry's printer control language of choice.  PostScript printers are usually a bit more expensive, but it is a device-independent, open programming language and you're always 100% sure that they will work.  These days, however, the importance of this rule of thumb is dwindling.</para>
</sect2>

</sect1>
<sect1 id="sect_08_03"><title>Print problems</title>
<para>In this section, we will discuss what you can do as a user when something goes wrong.  We won't discuss any problems that have to do with the daemon-part of the printing service, as that is a task for system administrators.</para>
<sect2 id="sect_08_03_01"><title>Wrong file</title>
<para>If you print the wrong file, the job may be canceled using the command <command>lprm <parameter>jobID</parameter></command>, where jobID is in the form <emphasis>printername-printjobnumber</emphasis> (get it from information displayed by <command>lpq</command> or <command>lpstat</command>).  This will work when other jobs are waiting to be printed in this printer's queue.  However, you have to be really quick if you are the only one using this printer, since jobs are usually spooled and send to the printer in only seconds.  Once they arrive on the printer, it is too late to remove jobs using Linux tools.</para>
<para>What you can try in those cases, or in cases where the wrong print driver is configured and only rubbish comes out of the printer, is power off the printer.  However, that might not be the best course of action, as you might cause paper jams and other irregularities.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_08_03_02">
<title>My print hasn't come out</title>

<note><title>CUPS web interface versus printer web interface</title>
<para>Note that this is not the CUPS web interface and only works for printers supporting this feature.  Check the documentation of your printer.</para></note>


<para>If your job ID is not there and not on the printer, contact your system administrator.  If your job ID is listed in the output, check that the printer is currently printing.  If so, just wait, your job will get done in due time.</para>
<para>If the printer is not printing, check that it has paper, check the physical connections to both electricity and data network.  If that's okay, the printer may need restarting.  Ask your system admin for advice.</para>
<para>In the case of a network printer, try printing from another host.  If the printer is reachable from your own host (see <xref linkend="chap_10"></xref> for the <command>ping</command> utility), you may try to put the formatted file on it, like <filename>file.ps</filename> in case of a PostScript printer, using an FTP client.  If that works, your print system is misconfigured.  If it doesn't work, maybe the printer doesn't understand the format you are feeding it.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_09_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>Although Linux is one of the safest operating systems in existence, and even if it is designed to keep on going, data can get lost.  Data loss is most often the consequence of user errors, but occasionally a system fault, such as a power failure, is the cause, so it's always a good idea to keep an extra copy of sensitive and/or important data.</para>
<sect2 id="sect_09_01_01"><title>Preparing your data</title>
<sect3 id="sect_09_01_01_01"><title>Archiving with tar</title>
<para>In most cases, we will first collect all the data to back up in a single archive file, which we will compress later on.  The process of archiving involves concatenating all listed files and taking out unnecessary blanks.  In Linux, this is commonly done with the <command>tar</command> command.  <command>tar</command> was originally designed to archive data on tapes, but it can also make archives, known as <emphasis>tarballs</emphasis>.</para>
<para><command>tar</command> has many options, the most important ones are cited below:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><option>-v</option>: verbose</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><option>-t</option>: test, shows content of a tarball</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><option>-x</option>: extract archive</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><option>-c</option>: create archive</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><option>-f</option> <filename>archivedevice</filename>: use <filename>archivedevice</filename> as source/destination for the tarball, the device defaults to the first tape device (usually <filename>/dev/st0</filename> or something similar)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><option>-j</option>: filter through <command>bzip2</command>, see <xref linkend="sect_09_01_01_02"></xref></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>It is common to leave out the dash-prefix with <command>tar</command> options, as you can see from the examples below.</para>
<note><title>Use GNU tar for compatibility</title>
<para>The archives made with a proprietary <command>tar</command> version on one system, may be incompatible with <command>tar</command> on another proprietary system.  This may cause much headaches, such as if the archive needs to be recovered on a system that doesn't exist anymore.  Use the GNU <command>tar</command> version on all systems to prevent your system admin from bursting into tears.  Linux always uses GNU tar.  When working on other UNIX machines, enter <command>tar <option>--help</option></command> to find out which version you are using.  Contact your system admin if you don't see the word GNU somewhere.</para></note>
<para>In the example below, an archive is created and unpacked.</para>
<screen>

<prompt>gaby:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ls *.jpg</command>
me+tux.jpg  nimf.jpg
</screen>
<para>This example also illustrates the difference between a tarred directory and a bunch of tarred files.  It is advisable to only compress directories, so files don't get spread all over when unpacking the tarball (which may be on another system, where you may not know which files where already there and which are the ones from the archive).</para>
<para>When a tape drive is connected to your machine and configured by your system administrator, the file names ending in <filename>.tar</filename> are replaced with the tape device name, for example:</para>
<para><command>tar <option>cvf</option> <filename>/dev/tape</filename> <filename>mail/</filename></command></para>
<para>The directory <filename>mail</filename> and all the files it contains are compressed into a file that is written on the tape immediately.  A content listing is displayed because we used the verbose option.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_09_01_01_02"><title>Incremental backups with tar</title>
<para>The <command>tar</command> tool supports the creation of incremental backups, using the <option>-N</option> option.  With this option, you can specify a date, and <command>tar</command> will check modification time of all specified files against this date.  If files are changed more recent than date, they will be included in the backup.  The example below uses the timestamp on a previous archive as the date value.  First, the initial archive is created and the timestamp on the initial backup file is shown.  Then a new file is created, upon which we take a new backup, containing only this new file:</para>

<prompt>jimmy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>tar xvf incremental1-javaproggies.tar</command>

</screen>
<para>Standard errors are redirected to <filename>/dev/null</filename>.  If you don't do this, <command>tar</command> will print a message for each unchanged file, telling you it won't be dumped.</para> 
<para>This way of working has the disadvantage that it looks at timestamps on files.  Say that you download an archive into the directory containing your backups, and the archive contains files that have been created two years ago.  When checking the timestamps of those files against the timestamp on the initial archive, the new files will actually seem old to <command>tar</command>, and will not be included in an incremental backup made using the <option>-N</option> option.</para>
<para>A better choice would be the <option>-g</option> option, which will create a list of files to backup.  When making incremental backups, files are checked against this list.  This is how it works:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>jimmy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>tar cvpf work-20030121.tar -g snapshot-20030121 work/</command>
work/
work/file1
work/file2
work/file3

<prompt>jimmy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>file snapshot-20030121</command>
snapshot-20030121: ASCII text
</screen>
<para>The next day, user <emphasis>jimmy</emphasis> works on <filename>file3</filename> a bit more, and creates <filename>file4</filename>.  At the end of the day, he makes a new backup:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>jimmy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>tar cvpf work-20030122.tar -g snapshot-20030121 work/</command>
work/
work/file3
work/file4
</screen>
<para>These are some very simple examples, but you could also use this kind of command in a cronjob (see <xref linkend="sect_04_04_04"></xref>), which specifies for instance a snapshot file for the weekly backup and one for the daily backup.  Snapshot files should be replaced when taking full backups, in that case.</para>
<para>More information can be found in the <command>tar</command> documentation.</para>
<tip><title>The real stuff</title>
<para>As you could probably notice, <command>tar</command> is OK when we are talking about a simple directory, a set of files that belongs together.  There are tools that are easier to manage, however, when you want to archive entire partitions or disks or larger projects.  We just explain about <command>tar</command> here because it is a very popular tool for distributing archives.  It will happen quite often that you need to install a software that comes in a so-called <quote>compressed tar ball</quote>.  See <xref linkend="sect_09_03"></xref> for an easier way to perform regular backups.</para>
</tip>

<sect3 id="sect_09_01_01_03"><title>Compressing and unpacking with <command>gzip</command> or <command>bzip2</command></title>
<para>
Data, including tarballs, can be compressed using zip tools.  The <command>gzip</command> command will add the suffix .gz to the file name and remove the original file.
</para>

<para>Uncompress gzipped files with the <option>-d</option> option.</para>
<para><command>bzip2</command> works in a similar way, but uses an improved compression algorithm, thus creating smaller files.  See the <command>bzip2</command> info pages for more.</para>

<para>Linux software packages are often distributed in a gzipped tarball.  The sensible thing to do after unpacking that kind of archives is find the <filename>README</filename> and read it.  It will generally contain guidelines to installing the package.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_09_01_01_04"><title>Java archives</title>
<para>The GNU project provides us with the <command>jar</command> tool for creating Java archives.  It is a Java application that combines multiple files into a single JAR archive file.  While also being a general purpose archiving and compression tool, based on ZIP and the ZLIB compression format, <command>jar</command> was mainly designed to facilitate the packing of Java code, applets and/or applications in a single file.  When combined in a single archive, the components of a Java application, can be downloaded much faster.</para>
<para>Unlike <command>tar</command>, <command>jar</command> compresses by default, independent from other tools - because it is basically the Java version of <command>zip</command>.  In addition, it allows individual entries in an archive to be signed by the author, so that origins can be authenticated.</para>
<para>The syntax is almost identical as for the <command>tar</command> command, we refer to <command>info <parameter>jar</parameter></command> for specific differences.</para>
<note><title>tar, jar and symbolic links</title>
<para>One noteworthy feature not really mentioned in the standard documentation is that <command>jar</command> will follow symbolic links.  Data to which these links are pointing will be included in the archive.  The default in <command>tar</command> is to only backup the symbolic link, but this behavior can be changed using the <option>-h</option> to <command>tar</command>.</para>

<para>On most Linux systems, users have access to the floppy disk device.  The name of the device may vary depending on the size and number of floppy drives, contact your system admin if you are unsure.  On sensibly administered systems, there will likely be a link <filename>/dev/floppy</filename> pointing to the right device, probably <filename>/dev/fd0</filename> (the auto-detecting floppy device) or <filename>/dev/fd0H1440</filename> (set for 1,44MB floppies).</para>
<para>
<command>fdformat</command> is the low-level floppy disk formatting tool.  It has the device name of the floppy disk as an option.  <command>fdformat</command> will display an error when the floppy is write-protected.

<sect2 id="sect_09_02_03"><title>Backups on/from jazz drives, USB devices and such</title>
<para>These devices are usually mounted into the file system.  After the mount procedure, they are accessed as normal directories, so you can use the standard commands for manipulating files.</para>
<para>In the example below, images are copied from a USB camera to the hard disk:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>robin:~&gt;</prompt> <command>mount <filename>/mnt/camera</filename></command>

<prompt>robin:~&gt;</prompt> <command>mount | grep <parameter>camera</parameter></command>
/dev/sda1 on /mnt/camera type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev)
</screen>
<para>If the camera is the only USB storage device that you ever connect to your system, this is safe.  But keep in mind that USB devices are assigned entries in <filename>/dev</filename> as they are connected to the system.  Thus, if you first connect a USB stick to your system, it will be on the <filename>/dev/sda</filename> entry, and if you connect your camera after that, it will be assigned to <filename>/dev/sdb</filename> - provided that you do not have any SCSI disks, which are also on <filename>/dev/sd*</filename>.  On newer systems, since kernel 2.6, a hotplug system called HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) ensures that users don't have to deal with this burden.  If you want to check where your device is, type <command>dmesg</command> after inserting it.</para>
<para>You can now copy the files:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>robin:~&gt;</prompt> <command>cp -R /mnt/camera/* images/</command>

<prompt>robin:~&gt;</prompt> <command>umount /mnt/camera</command>
</screen>
<para>Likewise, a jazz drive may be mounted on <filename>/mnt/jazz</filename>.</para>
<para>Appropriate lines should be added in <filename>/etc/modules.conf</filename> and <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> to make this work.  Refer to specific hardware HOWTOs for more information.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_09_02_04"><title>Backing up data using a tape device</title>
<para>This is done using <command>tar</command> (see above).  The <command>mt</command> tool is used for controlling the magnetic tape device, like <filename>/dev/st0</filename>.  Entire books have been written about tape backup, therefore, refer to our reading-list in <xref linkend="app2"></xref> for more information.  Keep in mind that databases might need other backup procedures because of their architecture.</para>
<para>The appropriate backup commands are usually put in one of the <emphasis>cron</emphasis> directories in order to have them executed on a regular basis.  In larger environments, the freely available <ulink url="http://www.amanda.org">Amanda</ulink> backup suite or a commercial solution may be implemented to back up multiple machines.

<para>The <command>rsync</command> program is a fast and flexible tool for remote backup.  It is common on UNIX and UNIX-like systems, easy to configure and use in scripts.

Your <quote>remote</quote> device might just as well be a USB storage device or another partition on your hard disk, you do not need to have two separated machines.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_09_03_02"><title>An example: rsync to a USB storage device</title>
<para>As discussed in <xref linkend="sect_03_01_02_03"></xref>, we will first have to mount the device.  This is done as <emphasis>root</emphasis>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>root@theserver# </prompt><command>mkdir <filename>/mnt/usbstore</filename></command>

<prompt>root@theserver# </prompt><command>mount <option>-t vfat</option> <filename>/dev/sda1 /mnt/usbstore</filename></command>
</screen>
<para>Note that this guideline requires USB support to be installed on your system.  See <ulink url="http://www.linux-usb.org/USB-guide/">the USB Guide</ulink> for help if this does not work.  Check with <command>dmesg</command> that <filename>/dev/sda1</filename> is indeed the device to mount.</para>
<para>Then you can start the actual backup, for instance of the <filename>/home/karl</filename> directory:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>karl@theserver:~&gt; </prompt><command>rsync <option>-avg</option> <filename>/home/karl /mnt/usbstore</filename></command>

<sect1 id="sect_10_01"><title>Networking Overview</title>
<sect2 id="sect_10_01_01"><title>Networking protocols</title>
<para>A protocol is, simply put, a set of rules for communication.</para>
<para>Linux supports many different networking protocols.  We list only the most important:</para>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_01"><title>TCP/IP</title>
<para>The Transport Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol are the two most popular ways of communicating on the Internet.  A lot of applications, such as your browser and E-mail program, are built on top of this protocol suite.</para>
<para>Very simply put, IP provides a solution for sending packets of information from one machine to another, while TCP ensures that the packets are arranged in streams, so that packets from different applications don't get mixed up, and that the packets are sent and received in the correct order.</para>
<para>The Internet was originally developed three decades ago for the United States Department of Defense (DoD), mainly for the purpose of interconnecting different-brand computers.  Another reason for the development of TCP/IP was to provide a reliable data transport system over an unreliable network.</para>
<para>TCP/IP networking has been present in Linux since its beginnings. It has been implemented from scratch. It is one of the most robust, fast and reliable implementations and is one of the key factors of the success of Linux.  Linux and networking are made for each other, in so much that not connecting your Linux system to the network may result in slow startup and other troubles.  Even if you don't use any network connections to other computers, networking protocols are used for internal system and application communications.  Linux expects to be networked.
</para>
<para>A good starting point for learning more about TCP and IP is in the following documents:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><command>man <option>7</option> <parameter>ip</parameter></command>: Describes the IPv4 protocol implementation on Linux (version 4 currently being the most wide-spread edition of the IP protocol).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><command>man <option>7</option> <parameter>tcp</parameter></command>: Implementation of the TCP protocol.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>RFC793, RFC1122, RFC2001 for TCP, and RFC791, RFC1122 and RFC1112 for IP.</para>
<para>The Request For Comments documents contain the descriptions of networking standards, protocols, applications and implementation.  These documents are managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force, an international community concerned with the smooth operation of the Internet and the evolution and development of the Internet architecture.</para>
<para>Your ISP usually has an RFC archive available, or you can browse the RFCs via <ulink url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html"></ulink>.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>


</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_02"><title>TCP/IPv6</title>
<para>Nobody expected the Internet to grow as fast as it does.  IP proved to have quite some disadvantages when a really large number of computers is in a network, the most important being the availability of unique addresses to assign to each machine participating.  Thus, IP version 6 was deviced to meet the needs of today's Internet.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, not all applications and services support IPv6, yet.  A migration is currently being set in motion in many environments that can benefit from an upgrade to IPv6.  For some applications, the old protocol is still used, for applications that have been reworked the new version is already active.  So when checking your network configuration, sometimes it might be a bit confusing since all kinds of measures can be taken to hide one protocol from the other so as the two don't mix up connections.</para>
<para>More information can be found in the following documents:</para>
<itemizedlist>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_03"><title>PPP, SLIP, PLIP, PPPOE</title>
<para>The Linux kernel has built-in support for PPP (Point-to-Point-Protocol), SLIP (Serial Line IP) and PLIP (Parallel Line IP). PPP is the most popular way individual users access their ISP (Internet Service Provider), although in densely populated areas it is often being replaced by PPPOE, PPP over Ethernet, the protocol used in cable modem connections.</para>
<para>Most Linux distributions provide easy-to-use tools for setting up an Internet connection.  The only thing you basically need is a username and password to connect to your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and a telephone number in the case of PPP.  These data are entered in the graphical configuration tool, which will likely also allow for starting and stopping the connection to your provider.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_04"><title>ISDN</title>
<para>The Linux kernel has built-in ISDN capabilities. Isdn4linux controls ISDN PC cards and can emulate a modem with the Hayes command set (<quote>AT</quote> commands). The possibilities range from simply using a terminal program to full connection to the Internet.</para>
<para>Check your system documentation.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_05"><title>AppleTalk</title>
<para>Appletalk is the name of Apple's internetworking stack. It allows a peer-to-peer network model which provides basic functionality such as file and printer sharing. Each machine can simultaneously act as a client and a server, and the software and hardware necessary are included with every Apple computer.</para>
<para>Linux provides full AppleTalk networking. Netatalk is a kernel-level implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite, originally for BSD-derived systems. It includes support for routing AppleTalk, serving UNIX and AFS file systems using AppleShare and serving UNIX printers and accessing AppleTalk printers.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_01_07"><title>SMB/NMB</title>
<para>For compatibility with MS Windows environments, the Samba suite, including support for the NMB and SMB protocols, can be installed on any UNIX-like system.  The Server Message Block protocol (also called Session Message Block, NetBIOS or LanManager protocol) is used on MS Windows 3.11, NT, 95/98, 2K and XP to share disks and printers.</para>
<para>The basic functions of the Samba suite are:  sharing Linux drives with Windows machines, accessing SMB shares from Linux machines, sharing Linux printers with Windows machines and sharing Windows printers with Linux machines.</para>
<para>Most Linux distributions provide a <emphasis>samba</emphasis> package, which does most of the server setup and starts up <command>smbd</command>, the Samba server, and <command>nmbd</command>, the netbios name server, at boot time by default.  Samba can be configured graphically, via a web interface or via the command line and text configuration files.  The daemons make a Linux machine appear as an MS Windows host in an MS Windows My Network Places/Network Neighbourhood window; a share from a Linux machine will be indistinguishable from a share on any other host in an MS Windows environment.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_10_01_02_01"><title>Configuration of local network interfaces</title>
<para>All the big, userfriendly Linux distributions come with various graphical tools, allowing for easy setup of the computer in a local network or for connecting it to an Internet Service Provider.  These tools can be started up from the command line or from a menu:</para>
<itemizedlist>

<para>Information you'll need to provide:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>For connecting to the local network, for instance with your home computers, or at work: hostname, domainname and IP address.  If you want to set up your own network, best do some more reading first.  At work, this information is likely to be given to your computer automatically when you boot it up.  When in doubt, it is better not to specify any information than making it up.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>For connecting to the Internet: username and password for your ISP, telephone number when using a modem.  Your ISP usually automatically assigns you a hostname, IP address and all the other things necessary for your Internet applications to work.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect3>

<sect3 id="sect_10_01_02_02"><title>Network configuration files</title>
<para>The graphical helper tools edit a specific set of network configuration files, using a couple of basic commands.  The exact names of the configuration files and their location in the file system is largely dependent on your Linux distribution and version.  However, a couple of network configuration files are common on all UNIX systems:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><filename>/etc/hosts</filename>: always contains the <emphasis>localhost</emphasis> IP address, 127.0.0.1, which is used for interprocess communication.  Never remove this line!  Sometimes contains addresses of additional hosts, which can be contacted without using an external naming service such as DNS (the Domain Name Server).</para>
<para>A sample <filename>hosts</filename> file for a small home network:</para>
<screen>
# Do not remove the following line, or various programs
# that require network functionality will fail.

<para>Read more in the <filename>resolv.conf</filename> man page.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para><filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename>: defines the order in which to contact different name services.  For Internet use, it is important that <emphasis>dns</emphasis> shows up in the <quote>hosts</quote> line:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[bob@tux ~]</prompt> <command>grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf</command>
hosts:	files dns
</screen>
<para>This instructs your computer to look up hostnames and IP addresses first in the <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> file, and to contact the DNS server if a given host does not occur in the local <filename>hosts</filename> file.  Other possible name services to contact are LDAP, NIS and NIS+.</para>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_01_02_03"><title>Network configuration commands</title>
<para>The distribution-specific scripts and graphical tools are front-ends to <command>ip</command> (or <command>ifconfig</command> and <command>route</command> on older systems) to display and configure the kernel's networking configuration.</para>
<para>The <command>ip</command> command is used for assigning IP addresses to interfaces, for setting up routes to the Internet and to other networks, for displaying TCP/IP configurations etcetera.</para>
<para>The following commands show IP address and routing information:</para>

<sect3 id="sect_10_01_02_04"><title>Network interface names</title>
<para>On a Linux machine, the device name <emphasis>lo</emphasis> or the <emphasis>local loop</emphasis> is linked with the internal 127.0.0.1 address.  The computer will have a hard time making your applications work if this device is not present; it is always there, even on computers which are not networked.</para>
<para>The first ethernet device, <emphasis>eth0</emphasis> in the case of a standard network interface card, points to your local LAN IP address.  Normal client machines only have one network interface card.  Routers, connecting networks together, have one network device for each network they serve.</para>
<para>If you use a modem to connect to the Internet, your network device will probably be named <emphasis>ppp0</emphasis>.  This is normally also the case for connections using a cable modem.</para>
<para>There are many more names, for instance for Virtual Private Network interfaces (VPNs), and multiple interfaces can be active simultaneously, so that the output of the <command>ifconfig</command> or <command>ip</command> commands might become quite extensive when no options are used.  Even multiple interfaces of the same type can be active.  In that case, they are numbered sequentially: the first will get the number 0, the second will get a suffix of 1, the third will get 2, and so on.  This is the case on many application servers, on machines which have a failover configuration, on routers, firewalls and many more.</para>

</screen>
<para>This is a typical client machine in an IP network. It only has one network device, <emphasis>eth0</emphasis>.  The <emphasis>lo</emphasis> interface is the local loop.</para>
<para>When this machine tries to contact a host that is on another network than its own, indicated by the line starting with 0.0.0.0, it will send the connection requests to the machine (router) with IP address 192.168.42.1, and it will use its primary interface, eth0, to do this.</para>
<para>Hosts that are on the same network, the line starting with 192.168.42.0, will also be contacted through the primary network interface, but no router is necessary, the data are just put on the network.</para>
<para>Machines can have much more complicated routing tables than this one, with lots of different <quote>Destination-Gateway</quote> pairs to connect to different networks.  If you have the occasion to connect to an application server, for instance at work, it is most educating to check the routing information.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_10_02"><title>Internet/Intranet applications</title>
<para>The Linux system is a great platform for offering networking services.  In this section, we will try to give an overview of most common network servers and applications.</para>
<sect2 id="sect_10_02_01"><title>Server types</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_01_01"><title>Standalone server</title>
<para>Offering a service to users can be approached in two ways.  A daemon or service can run in standalone mode, or it can be dependent on another service to be activated.</para>
<para>Network services that are heavily and/or continuously used, usually run in the standalone mode: they are independent program daemons that are always running.  They are most likely started up at system boot time, and they wait for requests on the specific connection points or ports for which they are set up to listen.  When a request comes, it is processed, and the listening continues until the next request.  A web server is a typical example: you want it to be available 24 hours a day, and if it is too busy it should create more listening instances to serve simultaneous users.  Other examples are the large software archives such as <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</ulink> or <ulink url="http://tucows.com">your Tucows mirror</ulink>, which must handle thousands of FTP requests per day.</para>
<para>An example of a standalone network service on your home computer might be the <command>named</command> (name daemon), a caching name server.  Standalone services have there own processes running, you can check any time using <command>ps</command>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>bob:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ps auxw | grep named</command>
named   908  0.0  1.0 14876 5108 ?   S  Mar14  0:07 named -u named
</screen>
<para>Most services on your home PC, such as the FTP service, don't have a running daemon, yet you can use them:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>bob:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ps auxw | grep ftp</command>
bob     738   690  0 16:17 pts/6    00:00:00 grep ftp

<prompt>ncftp / &gt;</prompt>
</screen>
<para>Let's see in the next section how this is arranged.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_01_02"><title>(x)inetd</title>
<para>On your home PC, things are usually a bit calmer.  You may have a small network, for instance, and you may have to transfer files from one PC to another from time to time, using FTP or Samba (for connectivity with MS Windows machines).  In those cases, starting all the services which you only need occasionally and having them run all the time would be a waste of resources.  So in smaller setups, you will find the necessary daemons dependent on a central program, that listen on all the ports of the services for which it is responsible.</para>  
<para>This super-server, the Internet services daemon, is started up at system initialization time.  There are two common implementations: <command>inetd</command> and <command>xinetd</command> (the extended Internet services daemon).  One or the other is usually running on every Linux system:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>bob:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ps -ef | grep inet</command>
root  926   1 0 Mar14 ?   00:00:00 xinetd-ipv6 -stayalive -reuse \
-pidfile /var/run/xinetd.pid
</screen>
<para>The services for which the Internet daemon is responsible, are listed in its configuration file, <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename>, for <command>inetd</command>, and in the directory <filename>/etc/xinetd.d</filename> for <command>xinetd</command>.  Commonly managed services include file share and print services, SSH, FTP, telnet, the Samba configuration daemon, talk and time services.</para>
<para>As soon as a connection request is received, the central server will start an instance of the required server.  Thus, in the example below, when user <emphasis>bob</emphasis> starts an FTP session to the local host, an FTP daemon is running as long as the session is active:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>bob:~&gt;</prompt> <command>ps auxw | grep ftp</command>
bob     793  0.1  0.2  3960 1076 pts/6    S    16:44   0:00 ncftp localhost
ftp     794  0.7  0.5  5588 2608 ?        SN   16:44   0:00 ftpd: 
localhost.localdomain: anonymous/bob@his.server.com: IDLE
</screen>
<para>Of course, the same happens when you open connections to remote hosts: either a daemon answers directly, or a remote <command>(x)inetd</command> starts the service you need and stops it when you quit.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="sect_10_02_02"><title>Mail</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_02_01"><title>Servers</title>
<para><emphasis>Sendmail</emphasis> is the standard mail server program or Mail Transport Agent for UNIX platforms.  It is robust, scalable, and when properly configured with appropriate hardware, handles thousands of users without blinking.  More information about how to configure Sendmail is included with the sendmail and sendmail-cf packages, you may want to read the <filename>README</filename> and <filename>README.cf</filename> files in <filename>/usr/share/doc/sendmail</filename>.  The <command>man <parameter>sendmail</parameter></command> and <command>man <parameter>aliases</parameter></command> are also useful.</para>
<para>Qmail is another mail server, gaining popularity because it claims to be more secure than Sendmail.  While Sendmail is a monolithic program, Qmail consists of smaller interacting program parts that can be better secured.  Postfix is another mail server which is gaining popularity.</para>
<para>These servers handle mailing lists, filtering, virus scanning and much more.  Free and commercial scanners are available for use with Linux.  Examples of mailing list software are Mailman, Listserv, Majordomo and EZmlm.  See the web page of your favorite virus scanner for information on Linux client and server support.  Amavis and Spamassassin are free implementations of a virus scanner and a spam scanner.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_02_02"><title>Remote mail servers</title>
<para>The most popular protocols to access mail remotely are <emphasis>POP3</emphasis> and <emphasis>IMAP4</emphasis>.  IMAP and POP both allow offline operation, remote access to new mail and they both rely on an SMTP server to send mail.</para>
<para>While POP is a simple protocol, easy to implement and supported by almost any mail client, IMAP is to be preferred because:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>It can manipulate persistent message status flags.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It can store as well as fetch mail messages.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It can access and manage multiple mailboxes.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It supports concurrent updates and shared mailboxes.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It is also suitable for accessing Usenet messages and other documents.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>IMAP works both on-line and off-line.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>it is optimized for on-line performance, especially over low-speed links.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_02_03"><title>Mail user-agents</title>
<para>There are plenty of both text and graphical E-mail clients, we'll just name a few of the common ones.  Pick your favorite.</para>
<para>The UNIX <command>mail</command> command has been around for years, even before networking existed.  It is a simple interface to send messages and small files to other users, who can then save the message, redirect it, reply to it and such.</para>
<para>While it is not commonly used as a client anymore, the <command>mail</command> program is still useful, for example to mail the output of a command to somebody:</para>
<cmdsynopsis><command>mail <email>future.employer@whereIwant2work.com</email> &lt; <filename>cv.txt</filename></command></cmdsynopsis>
<para>The <command>elm</command> mail reader is a much needed improvement to <command>mail</command>, and so is <command>pine</command> (Pine Is Not ELM).  The <command>mutt</command> mail reader is even more recent and offers features like threading.</para>
<para>For those users who prefer a graphical interface to their mail (and a tennis elbow or a mouse arm), there are hundreds of options.  The most popular for new users are Mozilla Mail/Thunderbird, which has easy anti-spam configuring options, and the Ximian MS Exchange clone, Evolution.</para>

<para>There are also tens of web mail applications available, such as <application>Squirrelmail</application>, <application>Yahoo!</application> mail, <application>gmail</application> from Google and <application>Hotmail</application>.</para>
<para>An overview is available via the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Mail-User-HOWTO/index.html">Linux Mail User HOWTO</ulink>.</para>

<para>Most Linux distributions include <command>fetchmail</command>, a mail-retrieval and forwarding utility.  It fetches mail from remote mail servers (POP, IMAP and some others) and forwards it to your local delivery system.  You can then handle the retrieved mail using normal mail clients.  It can be run in daemon mode to repeatedly poll one or more systems at a specified interval.  Information and usage examples can be found in the Info pages; the directory <filename>/usr/share/doc/fetchmail-&lt;version&gt;</filename> contains a full list of features and a FAQ for beginners.</para>

<para>The <command>procmail</command> filter can be used for filtering incoming mail, to create mailing lists, to pre-process mail, to selectively forward mail and more.  The accompanying <command>formail</command> program, among others, enables generation of auto-replies and splitting up mailboxes.  Procmail has been around for years on UNIX and Linux machines and is a very robust system, designed to work even in the worst circumstances.  More information may be found in the <filename>/usr/share/doc/procmail-&lt;version&gt;</filename> directory and in the man pages.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_10_02_03"><title>Web</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_03_01"><title>The Apache Web Server</title>
<para>Apache is by far the most popular web server, used on more than half of all Internet web servers.  Most Linux distributions include Apache.  Apache's advantages include its modular design, SSL support, stability and speed. Given the appropriate hardware and configuration it can support the highest loads.</para>
<para>On Linux systems, the server configuration is usually done in the <filename>/etc/httpd</filename> directory.  The most important configuration file is <filename>httpd.conf</filename>; it is rather self-explanatory.  Should you need help, you can find it in the <command>httpd</command> man page or on the <ulink url="http://www.apache.org">Apache website</ulink>.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_03_02"><title>Web browsers</title>
<para>A number of web browsers, both free and commercial, exist for the Linux platform.  Netscape Navigator as the only decent option has long been a thing of the past, as Mozilla/Firefox offers a competitive alternative running on many other operating systems, like MS Windows and MacOS X as well.</para>
<para>Amaya is the W3C browser.  Opera is a commercial browser, compact and fast.  Many desktop managers offer web browsing features in their file manager, like <command>nautilus</command>.</para>
<para>Among the popular text based browsers are <command>lynx</command> and <command>links</command>.  You may need to define proxy servers in your shell, by setting the appropriate variables.  Text browsers are fast and handy when no graphical environment is available, such as when used in scripts.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_10_02_04"><title>File Transfer Protocol</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_04_01"><title>FTP servers</title>
<para>On a Linux system, an FTP server is typically run from <command>xinetd</command>, using the <emphasis>WU-ftpd</emphasis> server, although the FTP server may be configured as a stand-alone server on systems with heavy FTP traffic.  See the exercises.</para>
<para>Other FTP servers include among others <emphasis>Ncftpd</emphasis> and <emphasis>Proftpd</emphasis>.</para>
<para>Most Linux distributions contain the <emphasis>anonftp</emphasis> package, which sets up an anonymous FTP server tree and accompanying configuration files.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_02_04_02"><title>FTP clients</title>
<para>Most Linux distributions include <command>ncftp</command>, an improved version of the common UNIX <command>ftp</command> command, which you may also know from the Windows command line.  The <command>ncftp</command> program offers extra features such as a nicer and more comprehensible user interface, file name completion, append and resume functions, bookmarking, session management and more:</para>

<para>Running a Usenet server involves a lot of expertise and fine-tuning, so refer to the <ulink url="http://www.isc.org">INN homepage</ulink> for more information.</para>
<para>There are a couple of interesting newsgroups in the <emphasis>comp.*</emphasis> hierarchy, which can be accessed using a variety of text and graphical clients.  A lot of mail clients support newsgroup browsing as well, check your program or see your local Open Source software mirror for text clients such as <command>tin</command>, <command>slrnn</command> and <command>mutt</command>, or download Mozilla or one of a number of other graphical clients.</para>
<para><ulink url="http://deja.com">Deja.com</ulink> keeps a searchable archive of all newsgroups, powered by Google.

<sect2 id="sect_10_02_07"><title>The Domain Name System</title>
<para>All these applications need DNS services to match IP addresses to host names and vice versa.  A DNS server does not know all the IP addresses in the world, but networks with other DNS servers which it can query to find an unknown address.  Most UNIX systems can run <command>named</command>, which is part of the bind (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) package distributed by the Internet Software Consortium.  It can run as a stand-alone caching <emphasis>nameserver</emphasis>, which is often done on Linux systems in order to speed up network access.</para>
<para>Your main client configuration file is <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>, which determines the order in which Domain Name Servers are contacted:</para>

<para>DHCP is the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, which is gradually replacing good old <command>bootp</command> in larger environments.  It is used to control vital networking parameters such as IP addresses and name servers of hosts.  DHCP is backward compatible with <command>bootp</command>.  For configuring the server, you will need to read the HOWTO.</para>
<para>DHCP client machines will usually be configured using a GUI that configures the <command>dhcpcd</command>, the DHCP client daemon.  Check your system documentation if you need to configure your machine as a DHCP client.</para>

<sect3 id="sect_10_02_09_03"><title>LDAP</title>
<para>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is a client-server system for accessing global or local directory services over a network.  On Linux, the OpenLDAP implementation is used.  It includes <command>slapd</command>, a stand-alone server; <command>slurpd</command>, a stand-alone LDAP replication server; libraries implementing the LDAP protocol and a series of utilities, tools and sample clients.</para>
<para> The main benefit of using LDAP is the consolidation of certain types of information within your organization. For example, all of the different lists of users within your organization can be merged into one LDAP directory. This directory can be queried by any LDAP-enabled applications that need this information. It can also be accessed by users who need directory information.
</para><para>
Other LDAP or X.500 Lite benefits include its ease of implementation (compared to X.500) and its well-defined Application Programming Interface (API), which means that the number of LDAP-enabled applications and LDAP gateways should increase in the future.
</para><para>
On the negative side, if you want to use LDAP, you will need LDAP-enabled applications or the ability to use LDAP gateways. While LDAP usage should only increase, currently there are not very many LDAP-enabled applications available for Linux. Also, while LDAP does support some access control, it does not possess as many security features as X.500.
</para>
<para> Since LDAP is an open and configurable protocol, it can be used to store almost any type of information relating to a particular organizational structure.  Common examples are mail address lookups, central authentication in combination with PAM, telephone directories and machine configuration databases.</para>
<para>See your system specific information and the man pages for related commands such as <command>ldapmodify</command> and <command>ldapsearch</command> for details.  More information can be found in the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDAP-HOWTO.html">LDAP Linux HOWTO</ulink>, which discusses installation, configuration, running and maintenance of an LDAP server on Linux.

<sect1 id="sect_10_03"><title>Remote execution of applications</title>
<sect2 id="sect_10_03_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>There are a couple of different ways to execute commands or run programs on a remote machine and have the output, be it text or graphics, sent to your workstation.  The connections can be secure or insecure.  While it is of course advised to use secure connections instead of transporting your password over the network unencrypted, we will discuss some practical applications of the older (unsafe) mechanisms, as they are still useful in a modern networked environment, such as for troubleshooting or running exotic programs.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_10_03_02"><title>Rsh, rlogin and telnet</title>
<para>The <command>rlogin</command> and <command>rsh</command> commands for remote login and remote execution of commands are inherited from UNIX.  While seldom used because they are blatantly insecure, they still come with almost every Linux distribution for backward compatibility with UNIX programs.</para>
<para>Telnet, on the other hand, is still commonly used, often by system and network administrators.  Telnet is one of the most powerful tools for remote access to files and remote administration, allowing connections from anywhere on the Internet.  Combined with an X server, remote graphical applications can be displayed locally.  There is no difference between working on the local machine and using the remote machine.</para>
<para>Because the entire connection is unencrypted, allowing <command>telnet</command> connections involves taking high security risks.  For normal remote execution of programs, Secure SHell or <command>ssh</command> is advised.  We will discuss the secure method later in this section.</para>
<para>However, <command>telnet</command> is still used in many cases.  Below are some examples in which a mail server and a web server are tested for replies:</para>

<sect2 id="sect_10_03_03"><title>The X Window System</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_03_03_01"><title>X features</title>
<para>As we already explained in Chapter 7 (see <xref linkend="sect_07_03_03"></xref>), the X Window system comes with an X server which serves graphics to clients that need a display.</para>
<para>It is important to realize the distinction between the X server and the X client application(s).  The X server controls the display directly and is responsible for all input and output via keyboard, mouse and display.  The X client, on the other hand, does not access the input and output devices directly.  It communicates with the X server which handles input and output.  It is the X client which does the real work, like computing values, running applications and so forth.  The X server only opens windows to handle input and output for the specified client.</para>
<para>In normal operation (runlevel five, graphical mode), every Linux workstation is an X server to itself, even if it only runs client applications.  All the applications you are running (for example, Gimp, a terminal window, your browser, your office application, your CD playing tool, and so on) are clients to your X server.  Server and client are running on the same machine in this case.</para>
<para>This client/server nature of the X system makes it an ideal environment for remote execution of applications and programs.  Because the process is actually being executed on the remote machine, very little CPU power is needed on the local host.  Such machines, purely acting as servers for X, are called X terminals and were once very popular.  More information may be found in the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/Remote-X-Apps.html">Remote X applications mini-HOWTO</ulink>.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_03_03_02"><title>Telnet and X</title>
<para>If you would want to use <command>telnet</command> to display graphical applications running on a remote machine, you first need to give the remote machine access to your display (to your X server!) using the <command>xhost</command> command, by typing a command similar to the one below in a terminal window on your local machine:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>davy:~&gt;</prompt> <command>xhost +remote.machine.com</command>
</screen>
<para>After that, connect to the remote host and tell it to display graphics on the local machine by setting the environment variable <varname>DISPLAY</varname>:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>[davy@remote ~]</prompt> <command>export DISPLAY="local.host.com:0.0"</command>
</screen>
<para>After completing this step, any application started in this terminal window will be displayed on your local desktop, using remote resources for computing, but your local graphical resources (your X server) for displaying the application.</para>
<para>This procedure assumes that you have some sort of X server (XFree86, Exceed, Cygwin) already set up on the machine where you want to display images.  The architecture and operating system of the client machine are not important as long as they allow you to run an X server on it.</para>
<para>Mind that displaying a terminal window from the remote machine is also considered to be a display of an image.</para>

<sect2 id="sect_10_03_04"><title>The SSH suite</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_03_04_01"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>Most UNIX and Linux systems now run Secure SHell in order to leave out the security risks that came with <command>telnet</command>.  Most Linux systems will run a version of OpenSSH, an Open Source implementation of the SSH protocol, providing secure encrypted communications between untrusted hosts over an untrusted network.  In the standard setup X connections are automatically forwarded, but arbitrary TCP/IP ports may also be forwarded using a secure channel.</para>
<para>The <command>ssh</command> client connects and logs into the specified host name.  The user must provide his identity to the remote machine as specified in the <filename>sshd_config</filename> file, which can usually be found in <filename>/etc/ssh</filename>.  The configuration file is rather self-explanatory and by defaults enables most common features.  Should you need help, you can find it in the <command>sshd</command> man pages.</para>
<para>When the user's identity has been accepted by the server, the server either executes the given command, or logs into the machine and gives the user a normal shell on the remote machine.  All communication with the remote command or shell will be automatically encrypted.</para>
<para>The session terminates when the command or shell on the remote machine exits and all X11 and TCP/IP connections have been closed.</para>
<para>When connecting to a host for the first time, using any of the programs that are included in the SSH collection, you need to establish the authenticity of that host and acknowledge that you want to connect:</para>
<screen>
<prompt>lenny ~&gt;</prompt> <command>ssh blob</command>
The authenticity of host 'blob (10.0.0.1)' can't be established.

<sect3 id="sect_10_03_04_02"><title>X11 and TCP forwarding</title>
<para>If the <varname>X11Forwarding</varname> entry is set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis> and the user is using X applications, the <varname>DISPLAY</varname> environment variable is set, the connection to the X11 display is automatically forwarded to the remote side in such a way that any X11 programs started from the shell will go through the encrypted channel, and the connection to the real X server will be made from the local machine.  The user should not manually set <varname>DISPLAY</varname>.  Forwarding of X11 connections can be configured on the command line or in the <command>sshd</command> configuration file.</para>
<para>The value for <varname>DISPLAY</varname> set by <command>ssh</command> will point to the server machine, but with a display number greater than zero.  This is normal, and happens because <command>ssh</command> creates a <emphasis>proxy</emphasis> X server on the server machine (that runs the X client application) for forwarding the connections over the encrypted channel.</para>
<para>This is all done automatically, so when you type in the name of a graphical application, it is displayed on your local machine and not on the remote host.  We use <command>xclock</command> in the example, since it is a small program which is generally installed and ideal for testing:</para>

</figure>
<para>SSH will also automatically set up Xauthority data on the server machine.  For this purpose, it will generate a random authorization cookie, store it in <filename>Xauthority</filename> on the server, and verify that any forwarded connections carry this cookie and replace it by the real cookie when the connection is opened.  The real authentication cookie is never sent to the server machine (and no cookies are sent in the plain).</para>
<para>Forwarding of arbitrary TCP/IP connections over the secure channel can be specified either on the command line or in a configuration file.</para>  
<note><title>The X server</title>
<para>This procedure assumes that you have a running X server on the client where you want to display the application from the remote host.  The client may be of different architecture and operating system than the remote host, as long as it can run an X server, such as Cygwin (which implements an XFree86 server for MS Windows clients and others) or Exceed, it should be possible to set up a remote connection with any Linux or UNIX machine.</para></note>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_03_04_03"><title>Server authentication</title>
<para>The <command>ssh</command> client/server system automatically maintains and checks a database containing identifications for all hosts it has ever been used with.  Host keys are stored in <filename>$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts</filename> in the user's home directory.  Additionally, the file <filename>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</filename> is automatically checked for known hosts.  Any new hosts are automatically added to the user's file.  If a host's identification ever changes, <command>ssh</command> warns about this and disables password authentication to prevent a Trojan horse from getting the user's password.  Another purpose of this mechanism is to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks which could otherwise be used to circumvent the encryption.  In environments where high security is needed, <command>sshd</command> can even be configured to prevent logins to machines whose host keys have changed or are unknown.</para>

<para>The SSH suite provides <command>scp</command> as a secure alternative to the <command>rcp</command> command that used to be popular when only <command>rsh</command> existed.  <command>scp</command> uses <command>ssh</command> for data transfer, uses the same authentication and provides the same security as <command>ssh</command>.  Unlike <command>rcp</command>, <command>scp</command> will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for authentication:</para>

<sect3 id="sect_10_03_04_05"><title>Authentication keys</title>
<para>The <command>ssh-keygen</command> command generates, manages and converts authentication keys for <command>ssh</command>.  It can create RSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 1 and RSA or DSA keys for use by SSH protocol version 2.</para>
<para>Normally each user wishing to use SSH with RSA or DSA authentication runs this once to create the authentication key in <filename>$HOME/.ssh/identity</filename>, <filename>id_dsa</filename> or <filename>id_rsa</filename>.  Additionally, the system administrator may use this to generate host keys for the system.</para>
<para>Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in which to store the private key.  The public key is stored in a file with the same name but <emphasis>.pub</emphasis> appended.  The program also asks for a passphrase.  The passphrase may be empty to indicate no passphrase (host keys must have an empty passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary length.</para>
<para>There is no way to recover a lost passphrase.  If the passphrase is lost or forgotten, a new key must be generated and copied to the corresponding public keys.</para>

<para>VNC or Virtual Network Computing is in fact a remote display system which allows viewing a desktop environment not only on the local machine on which it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of machines and architectures, including MS Windows and several UNIX distributions.  You could, for example, run MS Word on a Windows NT machine and display the output on your Linux desktop.  VNC provides servers as well as clients, so the opposite also works and it may thus be used to display Linux programs on Windows clients.  VNC is probably the easiest way to have X connections on a PC.  The following features make VNC different from a normal X server or commercial implementations:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>No state is stored at the viewer side:  you can leave your desk and resume from another machine, continuing where you left.  When you are running a PC X server, and the PC crashes or is restarted, all remote applications that you were running will die.  With VNC, they keep on running.</para></listitem>

<para>As soon as a computer is connected to the network, all kinds of abuse becomes possible, be it a UNIX-based or any other system.  Admittedly, mountains of papers have been spilled on this subject and it would lead us too far to discuss the subject of security in detail.  There are, however, a couple of fairly logical things even a novice user can do to obtain a very secure system, because most break-ins are the result of ignorant or careless users.</para>

<para>A rule of thumb is that if you don't recognize a particular service, you probably won't need it anyway.  Also keep in mind that some services are not really meant to be used over the Internet.

<sect2 id="sect_10_05_03"><title>Update regularly</title>
<para>Its ability to adapt quickly in an ever changing environment is what makes Linux thrive.  But it also creates a possibility that security updates have been released even while you are installing a brand new version, so the first thing you should do (and this goes for about any OS you can think of) after installing is getting the updates as soon as possible.  After that, update <emphasis>all</emphasis> the packages you use regularly.</para>
<para>Some updates may require new configuration files, and old files may be replaced.  Check the documentation, and ensure that everything runs normal after updating.</para>
<para>Most Linux distributions provide mailing list services for security update announcements, and tools for applying updates to the system.  General Linux only security issues are reported among others at <ulink url="http://linuxsecurity.com">Linuxsecurity.com</ulink>.</para>
<para>Updating is an ongoing process, so it should be an almost daily habit.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_10_05_04"><title>Firewalls and access policies</title>
<sect3 id="sect_10_05_04_01"><title>What is a firewall?</title>
<para>In the previous section we already mentioned firewall capabilities in Linux.  While firewall administration is one of the tasks of your network admin, you should know a couple of things about firewalls.</para>
<para><emphasis>Firewall</emphasis> is a vague term that can mean anything that acts as a protective barrier between us and the outside world, generally the Internet.  A firewall can be a dedicated system or a specific application that provides this functionality. Or it can be a combination of components, including various combinations of hardware and software. Firewalls are built from <quote>rules</quote> that are used to define what is allowed to enter and/or exit a given system or network.</para>
<para>After disabling unnecessary services, we now want to restrict accepted services as to allow only the minimum required connections.  A fine example is working from home: only the specific connection between your office and your home should be allowed, connections from other machines on the Internet should be blocked.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_05_04_02"><title>Packet filters</title>
<para>The first line of defense is a <emphasis>packet filter</emphasis>, which can look inside IP packages and make decisions based on the content.  Systems running the <command>ipchains</command> firewall are based on 2.2 kernels.  Newer systems (2.4 kernel) use <command>iptables</command>, a next generation packet filter for Linux, and the Gnome Lokkit tool.  This tool was only created to provide an easy interface for normal users.  It sets up a basic firewall configuration for a desktop, a dial-up or cable modem connection, and that's about it.  It should not be used in larger environments.</para>
<para>One of the most noteworthy enhancements in the newer kernels is the <emphasis>stateful inspection</emphasis> feature, which not only tells what is inside a packet, but also detects if a packet belongs or is related to a new or existing connection.</para>
<para>Development is ongoing, so it is best to check with each new version of a distribution which system is being used.</para>
<para>More information can be found at <ulink url="http://www.netfilter.org/">the netfilter/iptables project page</ulink>.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_05_04_03"><title>TCP wrappers</title>
<para>TCP wrapping provides much the same results as the packet filters, but works differently.  The wrapper actually accepts the connection attempt, then examines configuration files and decides whether to accept or reject the connection request.  It controls connections at the application level rather than at the network level.</para>
<para>TCP wrappers are typically used with <command>xinetd</command> to provide host name and IP-address-based access control.  In addition, these tools include logging and utilization management capabilities that are easy to configure.</para>
<para>The advantages of TCP wrappers are that the connecting client is unaware that wrappers are used, and that they operate separately from the applications they protect.</para>
<para>The host based access is controlled in the <filename>hosts.allow</filename> and <filename>hosts.deny</filename> files.  More information can be found in the TCP wrapper documentation files in <filename>/usr/share/doc/tcp_wrappers-&lt;version&gt;/</filename> and in the man pages for the host based access control files, which contain examples.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_05_04_04"><title>Proxies</title>
<para>Proxies can perform various duties, not all of which have much to do with security. But the fact that they are an intermediary make proxies a good place to enforce access control policies, limit direct connections through a firewall, and control how the network behind the proxy looks to the Internet.</para>
<para>Usually in combination with a packet filter, but sometimes all by themselves, proxies provide an extra level of control.  More information can be found in the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Firewall-HOWTO.html">Firewall HOWTO</ulink> or on the Squid website.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_05_04_05"><title>Access to individual applications</title>
<para>Some servers may have their own access control features.  Common examples include Samba, X11, Bind, Apache and CUPS.  For every service you want to offer check which configuration files apply.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_10_05_04_06"><title>Log files</title>
<para>If anything, the UNIX way of logging all kinds of activities into all kinds of files confirms that <quote>it is doing something.</quote>  Of course, log files should be checked regularly, manually or automatically.  Firewalls and other means of access control tend to create huge amounts of log files, so the trick is to try and only log abnormal activities.</para></sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_10_05_05"><title>Intrusion detection</title>

<para> Intrusion Detection Systems are designed to catch what might have gotten past the firewall. They can either be designed to catch an active break-in attempt in progress, or to detect a successful break-in after the fact. In the latter case, it is too late to prevent any damage, but at least we have early awareness of a problem.  There are two basic types of IDS:  those protecting networks, and those protecting individual hosts.</para>
<para> For host based IDS, this is done with utilities that monitor the file system for changes. System files that have changed in some way, but should not change, are a dead give-away that something is amiss. Anyone who gets in and gets root access will presumably make changes to the system somewhere. This is usually the very first thing done, either so he can get back in through a backdoor, or to launch an attack against someone else, in which case, he has to change or add files to the system.  Some systems come with the <command>tripwire</command> monitoring system, which is documented at the <ulink url="http://www.tripwire.org">Tripwire Open Source Project</ulink> website.</para> 
<para>Network intrusion detection is handled by a system that sees all the traffic that passes the firewall (not by portscanners, which advertise usable ports).  <ulink url="http://www.snort.org">Snort</ulink> is an Open Source example of such a program.  Whitehats.com features an open Intrusion detection database, <ulink url="http://www.whitehats.com">arachNIDS</ulink>.  </para>

<para>Linux and networking go hand in hand.  The Linux kernel has support for all common and most uncommon network protocols.  The standard UNIX networking tools are provided in each distribution.  Next to those, most distributions offer tools for easy network installation and management.</para>
<para>Linux is well known as a stable platform for running various Internet services, the amount of Internet software is endless.  Like UNIX, Linux can be just as well used and administered from a remote location, using one of several solutions for remote execution of programs.</para>
<para>We briefly touched the subject of security.  Linux is an ideal firewall system, light and cheap, but can be used in several other network functions such as routers and proxy servers.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_11_01"><title>Audio Basics</title>
<sect2 id="sect_11_01_01"><title>Installation</title>
<para>Most likely, your system is already installed with audio drivers and the configuration was done at installation time.  Likewise, should you ever need to replace your audio hardware, most systems provide tools that allow easy setup and configuration of the device.  Most currently available 
 plug-and-play sound cards should be recognized automatically.  If you can hear the samples that are played during configuration, just click <guibutton>OK</guibutton> 
and everything will be set up for you.</para>
<para>If your card is not detected automatically, you may be presented with a list of sound cards and/or of sound card properties from which to choose.  After that, you will have to provide the correct I/O port, IRQ and DMA settings.  Infor
mation about these settings can be found in your sound card documentation.  If you are on a dual boot system with MS Windows, this information can be found in t
he Windows Control Panel as well.</para>
<note><title>If automatic sound card detection fails</title>
<para>
If your soundcard is not supported by default, you will need to apply other tec
niques.  These are described in the <ulink url="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Sound-HOWTO/index.html">Linux Sound HOWTO</ulink>.</para>
</note>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_11_01_02"><title>Drivers and Architecture</title>
<para>There are generally two types of sound architecture: the older Open Sound System or OSS, which works with every UNIX-like system, and the newer Advanced Linux Sound Architecture or ALSA, that has better support for Linux, as the name indicates.  ALSA also has more features and allows for faster driver development.  We will focus here on the ALSA system.</para>

<para>Today, almost all mainstream audio chipsets are supported.  Only some high-end professional solutions and some cards developed by manufacturers refusing to document their chipset specifications are unsupported.  An overview of supported devices can be found on the ALSA site at <xref linked="http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/index.php?vendor=All#matrix"></xref>.</para>
<para>Configuring systems installed with ALSA is done using the <command>alsaconf</command> tool.  Additionally, distributions usually provide their own tools for configuring the sound card; these tools might even integrate the old and the new way of handling sound devices.</para>
</sect2>

<sect1 id="sect_11_02"><title>Sound and video playing</title>
<sect2 id="sect_11_02_01"><title>CD playing and copying</title>
<para>The <emphasis>cdp</emphasis> package comes with most distributions and provides <command>cdp</command> or <command>cdplay</command>, a text-based CD playe
r.  Desktop managers usually include a graphical tool, such as the <command>gnom
e-cd</command> player in Gnome, that can be started from a menu.</para>
<para>Be sure to understand the difference between an audio CD and a data CD.  
ou do not have to mount an audio CD into the file system in order to listen to it.  This is because the data on such a CD are not Linux file system data; they a
re accessed and sent to the audio output channel directly, using a CD player pr
gram.  If your CD is a data CD containing <filename>.mp3</filename> files, you will first need to mount it into the file system, and then use one of the program
s that we discuss below in order to play the music.  How to mount CDs into the file system is explained in <xref linkend="sect_07_06_05"></xref>.</para>
<para>The <command>cdparanoia</command> tool from the package with the same name
 reads audio directly as data from the CD, without analog conversions, and writes data to a file or pipe in different formats, of which <filename>.wav</filename> is probably the most popular.  Various tools for conversion to other formats, formats,  
 such as <filename>.mp3</filename>, come with most distributions or are downloadable as separate packages.  The GNU project provides several CD playing, ripping and encoding tools, database managers; see the <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/directory/audio/">Free Software Directory, Audio section</ulink> for detailed information.</para>
 <para>Audio-CD creation is eased, among many others, with the <command>kaudiocreator</command> tool from the KDE suite.  It comes with clear information from the KDE Help Center and is included on systems that have the <application>kdemultimedia</application> package installed.</para>

 <sect2 id="sect_11_02_02"><title>Playing music files</title>
 <sect3 id="sect_11_02_02_01"><title>mp3 files</title>
 <para>The popular <filename>.mp3</filename> format is widely supported on Linux
 machines.  Most distributions include multiple programs that can play these files.  Among many other applications, <application>XMMS</application>, which is presented in the screenshot below, is one of the most wide-spread, partially because it has the same look and feel as the Windows tool.</para>

  <note><title>Restrictions</title>
  <para>Some distributions don't allow you to play MP3's without modifying your configuration, this is due to license restrictions on the MP3 tools.  You might need to install extra software to be able to play your music.</para>

<sect1 id="sect_11_02_05"><title>Internet Telephony</title>
<sect2 id="sect_11_02_05_01"><title>What is it?</title>
<para>Internet telephony, or more common, Voice over IP (VoIP) or digital telephony allows parties to exchange voice data flows over the network.  The big difference is that the data flows over a general purpose network, the Internet, contrary to conventional telephony, that uses a dedicated network of voice transmission lines.  The two networks can be connected, however, under special circumstances, but for now this is certainly not a standard.  In other words: it is very likely that you will not be able to call people who are using a conventional telephone.</para>
<para>While there are currently various applications available for free download, both free and proprietary, there are some major drawbacks to telephony over the Internet.  Most noticably, the system is unreliable, it can be slow or there can be a lot of noise on the connection, and it can thus certainly not be used to replace conventional telephony - think about emergency calls.  While some providers take their precautions, there is no guarantee that you can reach the party that you want to call.</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="sect_11_05_02"><title>What do you need?</title>
<sect3 id="sect_11_05_02_01"><title>Server Side</title>
<para>First of all, you need a provider offering the service.  This service might integrate traditional telephony and it might or might not be free.  Among others are <ulink url="http://www.sipphone.com/">SIPphone</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.lingo.com/">Lingo</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.totaltalk.com/">AOL TotalTalk</ulink> and many locally accessible providers offering the so-called <quote>full phone service</quote>.  Internet phone service only is offered by <ulink url="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.sipbroker.com/">SIP Broker</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.google.com/talk/">Google</ulink> and many others.</para>
<para>If you want to set up a server of your own, you might want to look into <ulink url="http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</ulink>, <ulink url="http://gizmoproject.com/">Gizmo</ulink> or <ulink url="http://www.gnomemeeting.org/">GnomeMeeting</ulink>, just to name some.</para>
</sect3>
<sect3 id="sect_11_05_02_02"><title>Client Side</title>
<para>On the client side, the applications that you can use depend on your network configuration.  If you have a direct Internet connection, there won't be any problems, provided that you know on what server you can connect, and usually that you also have a username and password to authenticate to the service.</para>
<para>If you are behind a firewall that does Network Address Translation (NAT), however, some services might not work, as they will only see the IP address of the firewall and not the address of your computer, which might well be unroutable over the Internet, for instance when you are in a company network and your IP address starts with 10., 192.168. or another non-routable subnet prefix.  This depends on the protocol that is used by the application.</para>
<para>Also, available bandwidth might be a blocking factor: some applications are optimized for low bandwidth consumption, while others might require high bandwidth connections.  This depends on the codec that is used by the application.</para>
<para>Among the most common applications are the Skype client, which has an interface that reminds of instant messaging, and <ulink url="http://www.counterpath.com/">X-Lite</ulink>, the free version of the <application>XTen softphone</application>, which looks like a mobile telephone.  However, while these programs are available for free download and very popular, they are not free as in free speech: they use proprietary protocols and/or are only available in binary packages, not in source format.</para>
<para>Free <emphasis>and open</emphasis> VoIP clients are for instance <ulink url="http://www.gnomemeeting.org/">GnomeMeeting</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.wirlab.net/kphone/">KPhone</ulink>.</para>
<tip><title>Client hardware</title>
<para>While your computer, especially if it is a laptop PC, might have a built-in microphone, the result will be far better if you connect a headset.  If you have the choice, opt for a USB headset, as it functions independently from existing audio hardware.</para>
</tip>
<para>VoIP applications are definitely a booming market.  Volunteers try to document the current status at <ulink url="http://www.voip-info.org/"></ulink>.</para>

        <para>The table below shows major differences between the standard shell
            (<command>sh</command>), Bourne Again SHell (<command>bash</command>), Korn shell

            <para>Since the Bourne Again SHell is a superset of <command>sh</command>, all
                <command>sh</command> commands will also work in <command>bash</command> - but not
                vice versa. <command>bash</command> has many more features of its own, and, as the
                table below demonstrates, many features incorporated from other shells.</para>
            <para>Since the Turbo C shell is a superset of <command>csh</command>, all
                <command>csh</command> commands will work in <command>tcsh</command>, but not the
                other way round.</para>

        <para>The Bourne Again SHell has many more features not listed here. This table is just to
            give you an idea of how this shell incorporates all useful ideas from other shells:
            there are no blanks in the column for <command>bash</command>. More information on
            features found only in Bash can be retrieved from the Bash info pages, in the
                <quote>Bash Features</quote> section.</para>
        <para>More information:</para>
        <para>You should at least read one manual, being the manual of your shell. The preferred
            choice would be <command>info bash</command>, <command>bash</command> being the GNU
            shell and easiest for beginners. Print it out and take it home, study it whenever you
            have 5 minutes.</para>

            providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to
            software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
            whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
            works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>

        <title>Applicability and definitions</title>
        <para>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the
            copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The
            "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a
            licensee, and is addressed as "you".</para>
        <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a
            portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into
            another language.</para>
        <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document
            that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the
            Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing
            that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is
            in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
            The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with
            related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
            regarding them.</para>
        <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated,
            as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is
            released under this License.</para>
        <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover
            Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under
            this License.</para>
        <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a
            format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be
            viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for
            images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
            available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
            automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A
            copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to
            thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that
            is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>
        <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without
            markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
            DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats
            include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
            proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
            not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors
            for output purposes only.</para>
        <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following
            pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in
            the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
            Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding
            the beginning of the body of the text.</para>
    </sect1>
    <sect1 id="gfdl-2">
        <title>Verbatim copying</title>
        <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or
            noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license
            notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
            that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
            technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies
            you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If
            you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in
            section 3.</para>
        <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly
            display copies.</para>

    <sect1 id="gfdl-3">
        <title>Copying in quantity</title>
        <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the
            Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers
            that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
            cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly
            identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full
            title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other
            material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long
            as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
            as verbatim copying in other respects.</para>
        <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should
            put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue
            the rest onto adjacent pages.</para>
        <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
            you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,
            or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location
            containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which
            the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using
            public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take
            reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
            ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
            until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
            through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</para>
        <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well
            before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you
            with an updated version of the Document.</para>

0.1 Introduction/Credits
------------------------

This documentation is  part of a soon (or  so we hope) to be  released book on
the SuSE  Linux distribution. As  there is  no complete documentation  for the
/proc file system and we've used  many freely available sources to write these
chapters, it  seems only fair  to give the work  back to the  Linux community.
This work is  based on the 2.2.*  kernel version and the  upcoming 2.4.*. I'm
afraid it's still far from complete, but we  hope it will be useful. As far as
we know, it is the first 'all-in-one' document about the /proc file system. It
is focused  on the Intel  x86 hardware,  so if you  are looking for  PPC, ARM,
SPARC, APX, etc., features, you probably  won't find what you are looking for.
It also only covers IPv4 networking, not IPv6 nor other protocols - sorry. But
additions and patches  are welcome and will  be added to this  document if you
mail them to Bodo.

We'd like  to  thank Alan Cox, Rik van Riel, and Alexey Kuznetsov and a lot of
other people for help compiling this documentation. We'd also like to extend a
special thank  you to Andi Kleen for documentation, which we relied on heavily
to create  this  document,  as well as the additional information he provided.
Thanks to  everybody  else  who contributed source or docs to the Linux kernel
and helped create a great piece of software... :)

If you  have  any comments, corrections or additions, please don't hesitate to
contact Bodo  Bauer  at  bb@ricochet.net.  We'll  be happy to add them to this
document.

The   latest   version    of   this   document   is    available   online   at
http://skaro.nightcrawler.com/~bb/Docs/Proc as HTML version.

If  the above  direction does  not works  for you,  ypu could  try the  kernel
mailing  list  at  linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org  and/or try  to  reach  me  at

CHAPTER 1: COLLECTING SYSTEM INFORMATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In This Chapter
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Investigating  the  properties  of  the  pseudo  file  system  /proc and its
  ability to provide information on the running Linux system
* Examining /proc's structure
* Uncovering  various  information  about the kernel and the processes running
  on the system
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The proc  file  system acts as an interface to internal data structures in the
kernel. It  can  be  used to obtain information about the system and to change
certain kernel parameters at runtime (sysctl).

First, we'll  take  a  look  at the read-only parts of /proc. In Chapter 2, we
show you how you can use /proc/sys to change settings.

1.1 Process-Specific Subdirectories
-----------------------------------

The directory  /proc  contains  (among other things) one subdirectory for each
process running on the system, which is named after the process ID (PID).

The link  self  points  to  the  process reading the file system. Each process
subdirectory has the entries listed in Table 1-1.


Table 1-1: Process specific entries in /proc 
..............................................................................
 File    Content                                        
 cmdline Command line arguments                         
 cpu	 Current and last cpu in wich it was executed		(2.4)(smp)
 cwd	 Link to the current working directory
 environ Values of environment variables      
 exe	 Link to the executable of this process
 fd      Directory, which contains all file descriptors 
 maps	 Memory maps to executables and library files		(2.4)
 mem     Memory held by this process                    
 root	 Link to the root directory of this process
 stat    Process status                                 
 statm   Process memory status information              
 status  Process status in human readable form          
..............................................................................

For example, to get the status information of a process, all you have to do is
read the file /proc/PID/status:

  &gt;cat /proc/self/status 
  Name:   cat 
  State:  R (running) 
  Pid:    5452 
  PPid:   743 
  TracerPid:      0						(2.4)
  Uid:    501     501     501     501 
  Gid:    100     100     100     100 
  Groups: 100 14 16 
  VmSize:     1112 kB 
  VmLck:         0 kB 
  VmRSS:       348 kB 
  VmData:       24 kB 
  VmStk:        12 kB 
  VmExe:         8 kB 
  VmLib:      1044 kB 
  SigPnd: 0000000000000000 
  SigBlk: 0000000000000000 
  SigIgn: 0000000000000000 
  SigCgt: 0000000000000000 
  CapInh: 00000000fffffeff 
  CapPrm: 0000000000000000 
  CapEff: 0000000000000000 


This shows you nearly the same information you would get if you viewed it with
the ps  command.  In  fact,  ps  uses  the  proc  file  system  to  obtain its
information. The  statm  file  contains  more  detailed  information about the
process memory usage. Its seven fields are explained in Table 1-2.


Table 1-2: Contents of the statm files 
..............................................................................
 File     Content                         
 size     total program size              
 resident size of memory portions         
 shared   number of pages that are shared 
 trs      number of pages that are 'code' 
 drs      number of pages of data/stack   
 lrs      number of pages of library      
 dt       number of dirty pages           
..............................................................................

1.2 Kernel data
---------------

Similar to  the  process entries, the kernel data files give information about
the running kernel. The files used to obtain this information are contained in
/proc and  are  listed  in Table 1-3. Not all of these will be present in your
system. It  depends  on the kernel configuration and the loaded modules, which
files are there, and which are missing.

Table 1-3: Kernel info in /proc

You can,  for  example,  check  which interrupts are currently in use and what
they are used for by looking in the file /proc/interrupts:

  &gt; cat /proc/interrupts 
             CPU0        
    0:    8728810          XT-PIC  timer 
    1:        895          XT-PIC  keyboard 
    2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade 
    3:     531695          XT-PIC  aha152x 
    4:    2014133          XT-PIC  serial 
    5:      44401          XT-PIC  pcnet_cs 
    8:          2          XT-PIC  rtc 
   11:          8          XT-PIC  i82365 
   12:     182918          XT-PIC  PS/2 Mouse 
   13:          1          XT-PIC  fpu 
   14:    1232265          XT-PIC  ide0 
   15:          7          XT-PIC  ide1 
  NMI:          0 

In 2.4.* a couple of lines where added to this file LOC &amp; ERR (this time is the
output of a SMP machine):

  &gt; cat /proc/interrupts 

             CPU0       CPU1       
    0:    1243498    1214548    IO-APIC-edge  timer
    1:       8949       8958    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
    2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
    5:      11286      10161    IO-APIC-edge  soundblaster
    8:          1          0    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
    9:      27422      27407    IO-APIC-edge  3c503
   12:     113645     113873    IO-APIC-edge  PS/2 Mouse
   13:          0          0          XT-PIC  fpu
   14:      22491      24012    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
   15:       2183       2415    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
   17:      30564      30414   IO-APIC-level  eth0
   18:        177        164   IO-APIC-level  bttv
  NMI:    2457961    2457959 
  LOC:    2457882    2457881 
  ERR:       2155

NMI is incremented in this case because every timer interrupt generates a NMI
(Non Maskable Interrupt) which is used by the NMI Watchdog to detect lookups.

LOC is the local interrupt counter of the internal APIC of every CPU.

ERR is incremented in the case of errors in the IO-APIC bus (the bus that
connects the CPUs in a SMP system. This means that an error has been detected,
the IO-APIC automatically retry the transmission, so it should not be a big
problem, but you should read the SMP-FAQ.

In this context it could be interesting to note the new irq directory in 2.4.
It could be used to set IRQ to CPU affinity, this means that you can "hook" an
IRQ to only one CPU, or to exclude a CPU of handling IRQs. The contents of the
irq subdir is one subdir for each IRQ, and one file; prof_cpu_mask

For example 
  &gt; ls /proc/irq/
  0  10  12  14  16  18  2  4  6  8  prof_cpu_mask
  1  11  13  15  17  19  3  5  7  9
  &gt; ls /proc/irq/0/
  smp_affinity

The contents of the prof_cpu_mask file and each smp_affinity file for each IRQ
is the same by default:

  &gt; cat /proc/irq/0/smp_affinity 
  ffffffff

It's a bitmask, in wich you can specify wich CPUs can handle the IRQ, you can
set it by doing:

  &gt; echo 1 &gt; /proc/irq/prof_cpu_mask

This means that only the first CPU will handle the IRQ, but you can also echo 5
wich means that only the first and fourth CPU can handle the IRQ.

The way IRQs are routed is handled by the IO-APIC, and it's Round Robin
between all the CPUs which are allowed to handle it. As usual the kernel has
more info than you and does a better job than you, so the defaults are the
best choice for almost everyone.

There are  three  more  important subdirectories in /proc: net, scsi, and sys.
The general  rule  is  that  the  contents,  or  even  the  existence of these
directories, depend  on your kernel configuration. If SCSI is not enabled, the
directory scsi  may  not  exist. The same is true with the net, which is there
only when networking support is present in the running kernel.

The slabinfo  file  gives  information  about  memory usage at the slab level.
Linux uses  slab  pools for memory management above page level in version 2.2.
Commonly used  objects  have  their  own  slab  pool (such as network buffers,
directory cache, and so on).

1.3 IDE devices in /proc/ide
----------------------------

The subdirectory /proc/ide contains information about all IDE devices of which
the kernel  is  aware.  There is one subdirectory for each IDE controller, the
file drivers  and a link for each IDE device, pointing to the device directory
in the controller specific subtree.

The file  drivers  contains general information about the drivers used for the
IDE devices:

  &gt; cat /proc/ide/drivers 
  ide-cdrom version 4.53 
  ide-disk version 1.08 


More detailed  information  can  be  found  in  the  controller  specific
subdirectories. These  are  named  ide0,  ide1  and  so  on.  Each  of  these
directories contains the files shown in table 1-4.


Table 1-4: IDE controller info in  /proc/ide/ide? 
..............................................................................
 File    Content                                 
 channel IDE channel (0 or 1)                    
 config  Configuration (only for PCI/IDE bridge)

 model   Type/Chipset of IDE controller          
..............................................................................

Each device  connected  to  a  controller  has  a separate subdirectory in the
controllers directory.  The  files  listed in table 1-5 are contained in these
directories.

..............................................................................

 smart_values     IDE disk management values                 
..............................................................................

The most  interesting  file is settings. This file contains a nice overview of
the drive parameters:

1.4 Networking info in /proc/net
--------------------------------

The subdirectory  /proc/net  follows  the  usual  pattern. Table 1-6 shows the
additional values  you  get  for  IP  version 6 if you configure the kernel to
support this. Table 1-7 lists the files and their meaning.

..............................................................................

You can  use  this  information  to see which network devices are available in
your system and how much traffic was routed over those devices:

  &gt; cat /proc/net/dev 
  Inter-|Receive                                                   |[...

  ...] 1703981     5535    0    0    0     3       0          0 

In addition, each Channel Bond interface has it's own directory.  For
example, the bond0 device will have a directory called /proc/net/bond0/.
It will contain information that is specific to that bond, such as the
current slaves of the bond, the link status of the slaves, and how
many times the slaves link has failed.

1.5 SCSI info
-------------

If you  have  a  SCSI  host adapter in your system, you'll find a subdirectory
named after  the driver for this adapter in /proc/scsi. You'll also see a list
of all recognized SCSI devices in /proc/scsi:

  &gt;cat /proc/scsi/scsi 
  Attached devices: 
  Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00 
    Vendor: IBM      Model: DGHS09U          Rev: 03E0 
    Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 03 
  Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 06 Lun: 00 
    Vendor: PIONEER  Model: CD-ROM DR-U06S   Rev: 1.04 
    Type:   CD-ROM                           ANSI SCSI revision: 02 


The directory  named  after  the driver has one file for each adapter found in
the system.  These  files  contain information about the controller, including
the used  IRQ  and  the  IO  address range. The amount of information shown is
dependent on  the adapter you use. The example shows the output for an Adaptec
AHA-2940 SCSI adapter:

  &gt; cat /proc/scsi/aic7xxx/0

    Total transfers 0 (0 reads and 0 writes) 


1.6 Parallel port info in /proc/parport
---------------------------------------

The directory  /proc/parport  contains information about the parallel ports of
your system.  It  has  one  subdirectory  for  each port, named after the port
number (0,1,2,...).

These directories contain the four files shown in Table 1-8.


Table 1-8: Files in /proc/parport 
..............................................................................
 File      Content                                                             
 autoprobe Any IEEE-1284 device ID information that has been acquired.         
 devices   list of the device drivers using that port. A + will appear by the
           name of the device currently using the port (it might not appear
           against any). 
 hardware  Parallel port's base address, IRQ line and DMA channel.             
 irq       IRQ that parport is using for that port. This is in a separate
           file to allow you to alter it by writing a new value in (IRQ
           number or none). 
..............................................................................

1.7 TTY info in /proc/tty
-------------------------

Information about  the  available  and actually used tty's can be found in the
directory /proc/tty.You'll  find  entries  for drivers and line disciplines in
this directory, as shown in Table 1-9.


Table 1-9: Files in /proc/tty 
..............................................................................
 File          Content                                        
 drivers       list of drivers and their usage                
 ldiscs        registered line disciplines                    
 driver/serial usage statistic and status of single tty lines 
..............................................................................

To see  which  tty's  are  currently in use, you can simply look into the file
/proc/tty/drivers:

  &gt; cat /proc/tty/drivers 
  pty_slave            /dev/pts      136   0-255 pty:slave 
  pty_master           /dev/ptm      128   0-255 pty:master 
  pty_slave            /dev/ttyp       3   0-255 pty:slave 
  pty_master           /dev/pty        2   0-255 pty:master 
  serial               /dev/cua        5   64-67 serial:callout 
  serial               /dev/ttyS       4   64-67 serial 
  /dev/tty0            /dev/tty0       4       0 system:vtmaster

Summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The /proc file system serves information about the running system. It not only
allows access to process data but also allows you to request the kernel status
by reading files in the hierarchy.

The directory  structure  of /proc reflects the types of information and makes
it easy, if not obvious, where to look for specific data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 2: MODIFYING SYSTEM PARAMETERS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In This Chapter
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Modifying kernel parameters by writing into files found in /proc/sys
* Exploring the files which modify certain parameters
* Review of the /proc/sys file tree
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A very  interesting part of /proc is the directory /proc/sys. This is not only
a source  of  information,  it also allows you to change parameters within the
kernel. Be  very  careful  when attempting this. You can optimize your system,
but you  can  also  cause  it  to  crash.  Never  alter kernel parameters on a
production system.  Set  up  a  development machine and test to make sure that
everything works  the  way  you want it to. You may have no alternative but to
reboot the machine once an error has been made.

To change  a  value,  simply  echo  the new value into the file. An example is
given below  in the section on the file system data. You need to be root to do
this. You  can  create  your  own  boot script to perform this every time your
system boots.

The files  in /proc/sys can be used to fine tune and monitor miscellaneous and
general things  in  the operation of the Linux kernel. Since some of the files
can inadvertently  disrupt  your  system,  it  is  advisable  to  read  both
documentation and  source  before actually making adjustments. In any case, be
very careful  when  writing  to  any  of these files. The entries in /proc may
change slightly between the 2.1.* and the 2.2 kernel, so if there is any doubt
review the kernel documentation in the directory /usr/src/linux/Documentation.
This chapter  is  heavily  based  on the documentation included in the pre 2.2
kernels, and became part of it in version 2.2.1 of the Linux kernel.

2.1 /proc/sys/fs - File system data
-----------------------------------

This subdirectory  contains  specific  file system, file handle, inode, dentry
and quota information.

Currently, these files are in /proc/sys/fs:

dentry-state
------------

Status of  the  directory  cache.  Since  directory  entries  are  dynamically
allocated and  deallocated,  this  file indicates the current status. It holds
six values, in which the last two are not used and are always zero. The others
are listed in table 2-1.


Table 2-1: Status files of the directory cache 
..............................................................................
 File       Content                                                            
 nr_dentry  Almost always zero                                                 
 nr_unused  Number of unused cache entries                                     
 age_limit  
            in seconds after the entry may be reclaimed, when memory is short 
 want_pages internally                                                         
..............................................................................

dquot-nr and dquot-max
----------------------

The file dquot-max shows the maximum number of cached disk quota entries.

The file  dquot-nr  shows  the  number of allocated disk quota entries and the
number of free disk quota entries.

If the number of available cached disk quotas is very low and you have a large
number of simultaneous system users, you might want to raise the limit.

file-nr and file-max
--------------------

The kernel  allocates file handles dynamically, but doesn't free them again at
this time.

The value  in  file-max  denotes  the  maximum number of file handles that the
Linux kernel will allocate. When you get a lot of error messages about running
out of  file handles, you might want to raise this limit. The default value is
4096. To change it, just write the new number into the file:

  # cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max 
  4096 
  # echo 8192 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/file-max 
  # cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max 
  8192 


This method  of  revision  is  useful  for  all customizable parameters of the
kernel - simply echo the new value to the corresponding file.

The three  values  in file-nr denote the number of allocated file handles, the
number of  used file handles, and the maximum number of file handles. When the
allocated file  handles  come close to the maximum, but the number of actually
used ones  is  far  behind,  you've  encountered  a peak in your usage of file
handles and you don't need to increase the maximum.

inode-state and inode-nr
------------------------

The file inode-nr contains the first two items from inode-state, so we'll skip
to that file...

inode-state contains  two  actual numbers and five dummy values. The numbers
are nr_inodes and nr_free_inodes (in order of appearance).

nr_inodes
~~~~~~~~~

Denotes the  number  of  inodes the system has allocated. This number will
grow and shrink dynamically.

nr_free_inodes
--------------

Represents the  number of free inodes. Ie. The number of inuse inodes is
(nr_inodes - nr_free_inodes).

super-nr and super-max
----------------------

Again, super  block structures are allocated by the kernel, but not freed. The
file super-max  contains  the  maximum  number  of super block handlers, where
super-nr shows the number of currently allocated ones.

Every mounted file system needs a super block, so if you plan to mount lots of
file systems, you may want to increase these numbers.

2.2 /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc - Miscellaneous binary formats
-----------------------------------------------------------

Besides these  files, there is the subdirectory /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc. This
handles the kernel support for miscellaneous binary formats.

Binfmt_misc provides  the ability to register additional binary formats to the
Kernel without  compiling  an additional module/kernel. Therefore, binfmt_misc
needs to  know magic numbers at the beginning or the filename extension of the
binary.

It works by maintaining a linked list of structs that contain a description of
a binary  format,  including  a  magic  with size (or the filename extension),
offset and  mask,  and  the  interpreter name. On request it invokes the given
interpreter with  the  original  program  as  argument,  as  binfmt_java  and
binfmt_em86 and  binfmt_mz  do.  Since binfmt_misc does not define any default
binary-formats, you have to register an additional binary-format.

There are two general files in binfmt_misc and one file per registered format.
The two general files are register and status.

Registering a new binary format
-------------------------------

To register a new binary format you have to issue the command

  echo :name:type:offset:magic:mask:interpreter: &gt; /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register 



with appropriate  name (the name for the /proc-dir entry), offset (defaults to
0, if  omitted),  magic, mask (which can be omitted, defaults to all 0xff) and
last but  not  least,  the  interpreter that is to be invoked (for example and
testing /bin/echo).  Type  can be M for usual magic matching or E for filename
extension matching (give extension in place of magic).

Check or reset the status of the binary format handler
------------------------------------------------------

If you  do a cat on the file /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status, you will get the
current status (enabled/disabled) of binfmt_misc. Change the status by echoing
0 (disables)  or  1  (enables)  or  -1  (caution:  this  clears all previously
registered binary  formats)  to status. For example echo 0 &gt; status to disable
binfmt_misc (temporarily).

Status of a single handler
--------------------------

Each registered  handler has an entry in /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc. These files
perform the  same function as status, but their scope is limited to the actual
binary format.  By  cating this file, you also receive all related information
about the interpreter/magic of the binfmt.

Example usage of binfmt_misc (emulate binfmt_java)
--------------------------------------------------

  cd /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc  
  echo ':Java:M::\xca\xfe\xba\xbe::/usr/local/java/bin/javawrapper:' &gt; register  
  echo ':HTML:E::html::/usr/local/java/bin/appletviewer:' &gt; register  
  echo ':Applet:M::&lt;applet::/usr/local/java/bin/appletviewer:' &gt; register 
  echo ':DEXE:M::\x0eDEX::/usr/bin/dosexec:' &gt; register 


These four  lines  add  support  for  Java  executables and Java applets (like
binfmt_java, additionally  recognizing the .html extension with no need to put
&lt;!--applet&gt; to  every  applet  file).  You  have  to  install  the JDK and the
shell-script /usr/local/java/bin/javawrapper  too.  It  works  around  the
brokenness of  the Java filename handling. To add a Java binary, just create a
link to the class-file somewhere in the path.

2.3 /proc/sys/kernel - general kernel parameters
------------------------------------------------

This directory  reflects  general  kernel  behaviors. As I've said before, the
contents depend  on  your  configuration.  Here you'll find the most important
files, along with descriptions of what they mean and how to use them.

acct
----

The file contains three values; highwater, lowwater, and frequency.

It exists  only  when  BSD-style  process  accounting is enabled. These values
control its behavior. If the free space on the file system where the log lives
goes below  lowwater  percentage,  accounting  suspends.  If  it  goes  above
highwater percentage,  accounting  resumes. Frequency determines how often you
check the amount of free space (value is in seconds). Default settings are: 4,
2, and  30.  That is, suspend accounting if there is less than 2 percent free;
resume it  if we have a value of 3 or more percent; consider information about
the amount of free space valid for 30 seconds

ctrl-alt-del
------------

When the value in this file is 0, ctrl-alt-del is trapped and sent to the init
program to  handle a graceful restart. However, when the value is greater that
zero, Linux's  reaction  to  this key combination will be an immediate reboot,
without syncing its dirty buffers.

[NOTE]
    When a  program  (like  dosemu)  has  the  keyboard  in  raw  mode,  the
    ctrl-alt-del is  intercepted  by  the  program  before it ever reaches the
    kernel tty  layer,  and  it is up to the program to decide what to do with
    it.

domainname and hostname
-----------------------

These files  can  be controlled to set the NIS domainname and hostname of your
box. For the classic darkstar.frop.org a simple:

  # echo "darkstar" &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/hostname 
  # echo "frop.org" &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/domainname 


would suffice to set your hostname and NIS domainname.

osrelease, ostype and version
-----------------------------

The names make it pretty obvious what these fields contain:

  &gt; cat /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease 
  2.2.12 
   
  &gt; cat /proc/sys/kernel/ostype 
  Linux 
   
  &gt; cat /proc/sys/kernel/version 
  #4 Fri Oct 1 12:41:14 PDT 1999 


The files  osrelease and ostype should be clear enough. Version needs a little
more clarification.  The  #4 means that this is the 4th kernel built from this
source base and the date after it indicates the time the kernel was built. The
only way to tune these values is to rebuild the kernel.

panic
-----

The value  in  this  file  represents  the  number of seconds the kernel waits
before rebooting  on  a  panic.  When  you  use  the  software  watchdog,  the
recommended setting  is  60. If set to 0, the auto reboot after a kernel panic
is disabled, which is the default setting.

printk
------

The four values in printk denote
* console_loglevel,
* default_message_loglevel,
* minimum_console_level and
* default_console_loglevel
respectively.

These values  influence  printk()  behavior  when  printing  or  logging error
messages, which  come  from  inside  the  kernel.  See  syslog(2)  for  more
information on the different log levels.

console_loglevel
----------------

Messages with a higher priority than this will be printed to the console.

default_message_level
---------------------

Messages without an explicit priority will be printed with this priority.

minimum_console_loglevel
------------------------

Minimum (highest) value to which the console_loglevel can be set.

default_console_loglevel
------------------------

Default value for console_loglevel.

sg-big-buff
-----------

This file  shows  the size of the generic SCSI (sg) buffer. At this point, you
can't tune  it  yet,  but  you  can  change  it  at  compile  time  by editing
include/scsi/sg.h and changing the value of SG_BIG_BUFF.

If you use a scanner with SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) you might want to set
this to a higher value. Refer to the SANE documentation on this issue.

modprobe
--------

The location  where  the  modprobe  binary  is  located.  The kernel uses this
program to load modules on demand.

2.4 /proc/sys/vm - The virtual memory subsystem
-----------------------------------------------

The files  in  this directory can be used to tune the operation of the virtual
memory (VM)  subsystem  of  the  Linux  kernel.  In addition, one of the files
(bdflush) has some influence on disk usage.

bdflush
-------

This file  controls  the  operation of the bdflush kernel daemon. It currently
contains nine  integer  values,  six of which are actually used by the kernel.
They are listed in table 2-2.


Table 2-2: Parameters in /proc/sys/vm/bdflush 
..............................................................................
 Value      Meaning

            buffers.

 dummy      Unused                                                             
..............................................................................

nfract
------

This parameter  governs  the  maximum  number  of  dirty buffers in the buffer
cache. Dirty means that the contents of the buffer still have to be written to
disk (as  opposed  to  a  clean  buffer,  which  can just be forgotten about).
Setting this  to  a  higher value means that Linux can delay disk writes for a
long time, but it also means that it will have to do a lot of I/O at once when
memory becomes short. A lower value will spread out disk I/O more evenly.

ndirty
------

Ndirty gives the maximum number of dirty buffers that bdflush can write to the
disk at  one  time.  A high value will mean delayed, bursty I/O, while a small
value can lead to memory shortage when bdflush isn't woken up often enough.

nrefill
-------

This is  the  number  of  buffers  that  bdflush  will add to the list of free
buffers when  refill_freelist()  is  called.  It is necessary to allocate free
buffers beforehand,  since  the  buffers  are  often  different sizes than the
memory pages  and some bookkeeping needs to be done beforehand. The higher the
number, the  more  memory  will be wasted and the less often refill_freelist()
will need to run.

nref_dirt
---------

When refill_freelist() comes across more than nref_dirt dirty buffers, it will
wake up bdflush.

age_buffer and age_super
------------------------

Finally, the age_buffer and age_super parameters govern the maximum time Linux
waits before  writing  out  a  dirty buffer to disk. The value is expressed in
jiffies (clockticks),  the  number of jiffies per second is 100. Age_buffer is
the maximum age for data blocks, while age_super is for filesystems meta data.

buffermem
---------

The three  values  in  this  file  control  how much memory should be used for
buffer memory.  The  percentage  is calculated as a percentage of total system
memory.

The values are:

min_percent
-----------

This is  the  minimum  percentage  of  memory  that  should be spent on buffer
memory.

borrow_percent
--------------

When Linux is short on memory, and the buffer cache uses more than it has been
allotted, the  memory  management  (MM)  subsystem will prune the buffer cache
more heavily than other memory to compensate.

max_percent
-----------

This is the maximum amount of memory that can be used for buffer memory.

freepages
---------

This file contains three values: min, low and high:

min
---
When the  number  of  free  pages  in the system reaches this number, only the
kernel can allocate more memory.

low
---
If the number of free pages falls below this point, the kernel starts swapping
aggressively.

high
----
The kernel  tries  to  keep  up to this amount of memory free; if memory falls
below this point, the kernel starts gently swapping in the hopes that it never
has to do really aggressive swapping.

kswapd
------

Kswapd is  the  kernel  swap  out daemon. That is, kswapd is that piece of the
kernel that  frees  memory when it gets fragmented or full. Since every system
is different, you'll probably want some control over this piece of the system.

The file contains three numbers:

tries_base
----------

The maximum  number  of  pages kswapd tries to free in one round is calculated
from this  number.  Usually  this  number  will  be  divided  by  4  or 8 (see
mm/vmscan.c), so it isn't as big as it looks.

When you  need to increase the bandwidth to/from swap, you'll want to increase
this number.

tries_min
---------

This is  the  minimum number of times kswapd tries to free a page each time it
is called. Basically it's just there to make sure that kswapd frees some pages
even when it's being called with minimum priority.

swap_cluster
------------

This is probably the greatest influence on system performance.

swap_cluster is  the  number  of  pages kswapd writes in one turn. You'll want
this value  to  be  large  so that kswapd does its I/O in large chunks and the
disk doesn't  have  to  seek  as  often, but you don't want it to be too large
since that would flood the request queue.

overcommit_memory
-----------------

This file  contains  one  value.  The following algorithm is used to decide if
there's enough  memory:  if  the  value of overcommit_memory is positive, then
there's always  enough  memory. This is a useful feature, since programs often
malloc() huge  amounts  of  memory 'just in case', while they only use a small
part of  it.  Leaving  this value at 0 will lead to the failure of such a huge
malloc(), when in fact the system has enough memory for the program to run.

On the  other  hand,  enabling this feature can cause you to run out of memory
and thrash the system to death, so large and/or important servers will want to
set this value to 0.

pagecache
---------

This file  does exactly the same job as buffermem, only this file controls the
amount of memory allowed for memory mapping and generic caching of files.

You don't  want  the  minimum level to be too low, otherwise your system might
thrash when memory is tight or fragmentation is high.

pagetable_cache
---------------

The kernel  keeps a number of page tables in a per-processor cache (this helps
a lot  on  SMP systems). The cache size for each processor will be between the
low and the high value.

On a  low-memory,  single  CPU system, you can safely set these values to 0 so
you don't  waste  memory.  It  is  used  on SMP systems so that the system can
perform fast  pagetable allocations without having to acquire the kernel memory
lock.

For large  systems,  the  settings  are probably fine. For normal systems they
won't hurt  a  bit.  For  small  systems  (  less  than  16MB ram) it might be
advantageous to set both values to 0.

swapctl
-------

This file  contains  no less than 8 variables. All of these values are used by
kswapd.

The first four variables
* sc_max_page_age,
* sc_page_advance,
* sc_page_decline and
* sc_page_initial_age
are used  to  keep  track  of  Linux's page aging. Page aging is a bookkeeping
method to  track  which pages of memory are often used, and which pages can be
swapped out without consequences.

When a  page  is  swapped in, it starts at sc_page_initial_age (default 3) and
when the  page  is  scanned  by  kswapd,  its age is adjusted according to the
following scheme:

* If  the  page  was used since the last time we scanned, its age is increased
  by sc_page_advance  (default  3).  Where  the  maximum  value  is  given  by
  sc_max_page_age (default 20).
* Otherwise  (meaning  it wasn't used) its age is decreased by sc_page_decline
  (default 1).

When a page reaches age 0, it's ready to be swapped out.

The variables  sc_age_cluster_fract, sc_age_cluster_min, sc_pageout_weight and
sc_bufferout_weight, can  be  used  to  control  kswapd's  aggressiveness  in
swapping out pages.

Sc_age_cluster_fract is used to calculate how many pages from a process are to
be scanned by kswapd. The formula used is

(sc_age_cluster_fract divided by 1024) times resident set size

So if you want kswapd to scan the whole process, sc_age_cluster_fract needs to
have a  value  of  1024.  The  minimum  number  of  pages  kswapd will scan is
represented by sc_age_cluster_min, which is done so that kswapd will also scan
small processes.

The values  of  sc_pageout_weight  and sc_bufferout_weight are used to control
how many  tries  kswapd  will make in order to swap out one page/buffer. These
values can  be used to fine-tune the ratio between user pages and buffer/cache
memory. When  you find that your Linux system is swapping out too many process
pages in  order  to  satisfy  buffer  memory  demands,  you may want to either
increase sc_bufferout_weight, or decrease the value of sc_pageout_weight.

2.5 /proc/sys/dev - Device specific parameters
----------------------------------------------

Currently there is only support for CDROM drives, and for those, there is only
one read-only  file containing information about the CD-ROM drives attached to
the system:

  &gt;cat /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/info 
  CD-ROM information, Id: cdrom.c 2.55 1999/04/25 
   
  drive name:             sr0     hdb 
  drive speed:            32      40 
  drive # of slots:       1       0 
  Can close tray:         1       1 
  Can open tray:          1       1 
  Can lock tray:          1       1 
  Can change speed:       1       1 
  Can select disk:        0       1 
  Can read multisession:  1       1 
  Can read MCN:           1       1 
  Reports media changed:  1       1 
  Can play audio:         1       1 


You see two drives, sr0 and hdb, along with a list of their features.

2.6 /proc/sys/sunrpc - Remote procedure calls
---------------------------------------------

This directory  contains four files, which enable or disable debugging for the
RPC functions NFS, NFS-daemon, RPC and NLM. The default values are 0. They can
be set to one to turn debugging on. (The default value is 0 for each)

2.7 /proc/sys/net - Networking stuff
------------------------------------

The interface  to  the  networking  parts  of  the  kernel  is  located  in
/proc/sys/net. Table  2-3  shows all possible subdirectories. You may see only
some of them, depending on your kernel's configuration.


Table 2-3: Subdirectories in /proc/sys/net 
..............................................................................
 Directory Content             Directory  Content            
 core      General parameter   appletalk  Appletalk protocol 
 unix      Unix domain sockets netrom     NET/ROM            
 802       E802 protocol       ax25       AX25               
 ethernet  Ethernet protocol   rose       X.25 PLP layer     
 ipv4      IP version 4        x25        X.25 protocol      
 ipx       IPX                 token-ring IBM token ring     
 bridge    Bridging            decnet     DEC net            
 ipv6      IP version 6                   
..............................................................................

We will  concentrate  on IP networking here. Since AX15, X.25, and DEC Net are
only minor players in the Linux world, we'll skip them in this chapter. You'll
find some  short  info on Appletalk and IPX further on in this chapter. Review
the online  documentation  and the kernel source to get a detailed view of the
parameters for  those  protocols.  In  this  section  we'll  discuss  the
subdirectories printed  in  bold letters in the table above. As default values
are suitable for most needs, there is no need to change these values.

/proc/sys/net/core - Network core options
-----------------------------------------

rmem_default
------------

The default setting of the socket receive buffer in bytes.

rmem_max
--------

The maximum receive socket buffer size in bytes.

wmem_default
------------

The default setting (in bytes) of the socket send buffer.

wmem_max
--------

The maximum send socket buffer size in bytes.

message_burst and message_cost
------------------------------

These parameters  are used to limit the warning messages written to the kernel
log from  the  networking  code.  They  enforce  a  rate  limit  to  make  a
denial-of-service attack  impossible. A higher message_cost factor, results in
fewer messages that will be written. Message_burst controls when messages will
be dropped.  The  default  settings  limit  warning messages to one every five
seconds.

netdev_max_backlog
------------------

Maximum number  of  packets,  queued  on  the  INPUT  side, when the interface
receives packets faster than kernel can process them.

optmem_max
----------

Maximum ancillary buffer size allowed per socket. Ancillary data is a sequence
of struct cmsghdr structures with appended data.

/proc/sys/net/unix - Parameters for Unix domain sockets
-------------------------------------------------------

There are  only  two  files  in this subdirectory. They control the delays for
deleting and destroying socket descriptors.

2.8 /proc/sys/net/ipv4 - IPV4 settings
--------------------------------------

IP version  4  is  still the most used protocol in Unix networking. It will be
replaced by  IP version 6 in the next couple of years, but for the moment it's
the de  facto  standard  for  the  internet  and  is  used  in most networking
environments around  the  world.  Because  of the importance of this protocol,
we'll have a deeper look into the subtree controlling the behavior of the IPv4
subsystem of the Linux kernel.

Let's start with the entries in /proc/sys/net/ipv4.

ICMP settings
-------------

icmp_echo_ignore_all and icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts
----------------------------------------------------

Turn on (1) or off (0), if the kernel should ignore all ICMP ECHO requests, or
just those to broadcast and multicast addresses.

Please note that if you accept ICMP echo requests with a broadcast/multi\-cast
destination address  your  network  may  be  used as an exploder for denial of
service packet flooding attacks to other hosts.

icmp_destunreach_rate, icmp_echoreply_rate, icmp_paramprob_rate and icmp_timeexeed_rate
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sets limits  for  sending  ICMP  packets  to specific targets. A value of zero
disables all  limiting.  Any  positive  value sets the maximum package rate in
hundredth of a second (on Intel systems).

IP settings
-----------

ip_autoconfig
-------------

This file contains the number one if the host received its IP configuration by
RARP, BOOTP, DHCP or a similar mechanism. Otherwise it is zero.

ip_default_ttl
--------------

TTL (Time  To  Live) for IPv4 interfaces. This is simply the maximum number of
hops a packet may travel.

ip_dynaddr
----------

Enable dynamic  socket  address rewriting on interface address change. This is
useful for dialup interface with changing IP addresses.

ip_forward
----------

Enable or  disable forwarding of IP packages between interfaces. Changing this
value resets  all other parameters to their default values. They differ if the
kernel is configured as host or router.

ip_local_port_range
-------------------

Range of  ports  used  by  TCP  and UDP to choose the local port. Contains two
numbers, the  first  number  is the lowest port, the second number the highest
local port.  Default  is  1024-4999.  Should  be  changed  to  32768-61000 for
high-usage systems.

ip_no_pmtu_disc
---------------

Global switch  to  turn  path  MTU  discovery off. It can also be set on a per
socket basis by the applications or on a per route basis.

ip_masq_debug
-------------

Enable/disable debugging of IP masquerading.

IP fragmentation settings
-------------------------

ipfrag_high_trash and ipfrag_low_trash
--------------------------------------

Maximum memory  used to reassemble IP fragments. When ipfrag_high_thresh bytes
of memory  is  allocated  for  this  purpose,  the  fragment handler will toss
packets until ipfrag_low_thresh is reached.

ipfrag_time
-----------

Time in seconds to keep an IP fragment in memory.

TCP settings
------------

tcp_ecn
-------

This file controls the use of the ECN bit in the IPv4 headers, this is a new
feature about Explicit Congestion Notification, but some routers and firewalls
block trafic that has this bit set, so it could be necessary to echo 0 to
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn, if you want to talk to this sites. For more info
you could read RFC2481.

tcp_retrans_collapse
--------------------

Bug-to-bug compatibility with some broken printers. On retransmit, try to send
larger packets to work around bugs in certain TCP stacks. Can be turned off by
setting it to zero.

tcp_keepalive_probes
--------------------

Number of  keep  alive  probes  TCP  sends  out,  until  it  decides  that the
connection is broken.

tcp_keepalive_time
------------------

How often  TCP  sends out keep alive messages, when keep alive is enabled. The
default is 2 hours.

tcp_syn_retries
---------------

Number of  times  initial  SYNs  for  a  TCP  connection  attempt  will  be
retransmitted. Should  not  be  higher  than 255. This is only the timeout for
outgoing connections,  for  incoming  connections the number of retransmits is
defined by tcp_retries1.

tcp_sack
--------

Enable select acknowledgments after RFC2018.

tcp_timestamps
--------------

Enable timestamps as defined in RFC1323.

tcp_stdurg
----------

Enable the  strict  RFC793 interpretation of the TCP urgent pointer field. The
default is  to  use  the  BSD  compatible interpretation of the urgent pointer
pointing to the first byte after the urgent data. The RFC793 interpretation is
to have  it  point  to  the last byte of urgent data. Enabling this option may
lead to interoperatibility problems. Disabled by default.

tcp_syncookies
--------------

Only valid  when  the  kernel  was  compiled  with CONFIG_SYNCOOKIES. Send out
syncookies when  the  syn backlog queue of a socket overflows. This is to ward
off the common 'syn flood attack'. Disabled by default.

Note that  the  concept  of a socket backlog is abandoned. This means the peer
may not  receive  reliable  error  messages  from  an  over loaded server with
syncookies enabled.

tcp_window_scaling
------------------

Enable window scaling as defined in RFC1323.

tcp_fin_timeout
---------------

The length  of  time  in  seconds  it  takes to receive a final FIN before the
socket is  always  closed.  This  is  strictly  a  violation  of  the  TCP
specification, but required to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

tcp_max_ka_probes
-----------------

Indicates how  many  keep alive probes are sent per slow timer run. Should not
be set too high to prevent bursts.

tcp_max_syn_backlog
-------------------

Length of  the per socket backlog queue. Since Linux 2.2 the backlog specified
in listen(2)  only  specifies  the  length  of  the  backlog  queue of already
established sockets. When more connection requests arrive Linux starts to drop
packets. When  syncookies  are  enabled the packets are still answered and the
maximum queue is effectively ignored.

tcp_retries1
------------

Defines how  often  an  answer  to  a  TCP connection request is retransmitted
before giving up.

tcp_retries2
------------

Defines how often a TCP packet is retransmitted before giving up.

Interface specific settings
---------------------------

In the directory /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf you'll find one subdirectory for each
interface the  system  knows about and one directory calls all. Changes in the
all subdirectory  affect  all  interfaces,  whereas  changes  in  the  other
subdirectories affect  only  one  interface.  All  directories  have  the same
entries:

accept_redirects
----------------

This switch  decides  if the kernel accepts ICMP redirect messages or not. The
default is 'yes' if the kernel is configured for a regular host and 'no' for a
router configuration.

accept_source_route
-------------------

Should source  routed  packages  be  accepted  or  declined.  The  default  is
dependent on  the  kernel  configuration.  It's 'yes' for routers and 'no' for
hosts.

bootp_relay
~~~~~~~~~~~

Accept packets  with source address 0.b.c.d with destinations not to this host
as local ones. It is supposed that a BOOTP relay daemon will catch and forward
such packets.

The default  is  0,  since this feature is not implemented yet (kernel version
2.2.12).

forwarding
----------

Enable or disable IP forwarding on this interface.

log_martians
------------

Log packets with source addresses with no known route to kernel log.

mc_forwarding
-------------

Do multicast routing. The kernel needs to be compiled with CONFIG_MROUTE and a
multicast routing daemon is required.

proxy_arp
---------

Does (1) or does not (0) perform proxy ARP.

rp_filter
---------

Integer value determines if a source validation should be made. 1 means yes, 0
means no.  Disabled by default, but local/broadcast address spoofing is always
on.

If you  set this to 1 on a router that is the only connection for a network to
the net,  it  will  prevent  spoofing  attacks  against your internal networks
(external addresses  can  still  be  spoofed), without the need for additional
firewall rules.

secure_redirects
----------------

Accept ICMP  redirect  messages  only  for gateways, listed in default gateway
list. Enabled by default.

shared_media
------------

If it  is  not  set  the kernel does not assume that different subnets on this
device can communicate directly. Default setting is 'yes'.

send_redirects
--------------

Determines whether to send ICMP redirects to other hosts.

Routing settings
----------------

The directory  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route  contains  several  file  to  control
routing issues.

error_burst and error_cost
--------------------------

These parameters  are used to limit the warning messages written to the kernel
log from  the  routing  code.  The  higher the error_cost factor is, the fewer
messages will  be written. Error_burst controls when messages will be dropped.
The default settings limit warning messages to one every five seconds.

flush
-----

Writing to this file results in a flush of the routing cache.

gc_elastic, gc_interval, gc_min_interval, gc_tresh, gc_timeout
--------------------------------------------------------------

Values to  control  the  frequency  and  behavior  of  the  garbage collection
algorithm for the routing cache.

max_size
--------

Maximum size  of  the routing cache. Old entries will be purged once the cache
reached has this size.

max_delay, min_delay
--------------------

Delays for flushing the routing cache.

redirect_load, redirect_number
------------------------------

Factors which  determine  if  more ICPM redirects should be sent to a specific
host. No  redirects  will be sent once the load limit or the maximum number of
redirects has been reached.

redirect_silence
----------------

Timeout for redirects. After this period redirects will be sent again, even if
this has been stopped, because the load or number limit has been reached.

Network Neighbor handling
-------------------------

Settings about how to handle connections with direct neighbors (nodes attached
to the same link) can be found in the directory /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh.

As we  saw  it  in  the  conf directory, there is a default subdirectory which
holds the  default  values, and one directory for each interface. The contents
of the  directories  are identical, with the single exception that the default
settings contain additional options to set garbage collection parameters.

In the interface directories you'll find the following entries:

base_reachable_time
-------------------

A base  value  used for computing the random reachable time value as specified
in RFC2461.

retrans_time
------------

The time,  expressed  in  jiffies  (1/100 sec), between retransmitted Neighbor
Solicitation messages.  Used  for  address  resolution  and  to determine if a
neighbor is unreachable.

unres_qlen
----------

Maximum queue  length  for a pending arp request - the number of packets which
are accepted from other layers while the ARP address is still resolved.

anycast_delay
-------------

Maximum for  random  delay  of  answers  to  neighbor solicitation messages in
jiffies (1/100  sec). Not yet implemented (Linux does not have anycast support
yet).

ucast_solicit
-------------

Maximum number of retries for unicast solicitation.

mcast_solicit
-------------

Maximum number of retries for multicast solicitation.

delay_first_probe_time
----------------------

Delay for  the  first  time  probe  if  the  neighbor  is  reachable.  (see
gc_stale_time)

locktime
--------

An ARP/neighbor  entry  is only replaced with a new one if the old is at least
locktime old. This prevents ARP cache thrashing.

proxy_delay
-----------

Maximum time  (real  time is random [0..proxytime]) before answering to an ARP
request for  which  we have an proxy ARP entry. In some cases, this is used to
prevent network flooding.

proxy_qlen
----------

Maximum queue length of the delayed proxy arp timer. (see proxy_delay).

app_solcit
----------

Determines the  number of requests to send to the user level ARP daemon. Use 0
to turn off.

gc_stale_time
-------------

Determines how  often  to  check  for stale ARP entries. After an ARP entry is
stale it  will  be resolved again (which is useful when an IP address migrates
to another  machine).  When  ucast_solicit is greater than 0 it first tries to
send an  ARP  packet  directly  to  the  known  host  When  that  fails  and
mcast_solicit is greater than 0, an ARP request is broadcasted.

2.9 Appletalk
-------------

The /proc/sys/net/appletalk  directory  holds the Appletalk configuration data
when Appletalk is loaded. The configurable parameters are:

aarp-expiry-time
----------------

The amount  of  time  we keep an ARP entry before expiring it. Used to age out
old hosts.

aarp-resolve-time
-----------------

The amount of time we will spend trying to resolve an Appletalk address.

aarp-retransmit-limit
---------------------

The number of times we will retransmit a query before giving up.

aarp-tick-time
--------------

Controls the rate at which expires are checked.

The directory  /proc/net/appletalk  holds the list of active Appletalk sockets
on a machine.

The fields  indicate  the DDP type, the local address (in network:node format)
the remote  address,  the  size of the transmit pending queue, the size of the
received queue  (bytes waiting for applications to read) the state and the uid
owning the socket.

/proc/net/atalk_iface lists  all  the  interfaces  configured for appletalk.It
shows the  name  of the interface, its Appletalk address, the network range on
that address  (or  network number for phase 1 networks), and the status of the
interface.

/proc/net/atalk_route lists  each  known  network  route.  It lists the target
(network) that the route leads to, the router (may be directly connected), the
route flags, and the device the route is using.

2.10 IPX
--------

The IPX protocol has no tunable values in proc/sys/net.

The IPX  protocol  does,  however,  provide  proc/net/ipx. This lists each IPX
socket giving  the  local  and  remote  addresses  in  Novell  format (that is
network:node:port). In  accordance  with  the  strange  Novell  tradition,
everything but the port is in hex. Not_Connected is displayed for sockets that
are not  tied to a specific remote address. The Tx and Rx queue sizes indicate
the number  of  bytes  pending  for  transmission  and  reception.  The  state
indicates the  state  the  socket  is  in and the uid is the owning uid of the
socket.

The /proc/net/ipx_interface  file lists all IPX interfaces. For each interface
it gives  the network number, the node number, and indicates if the network is
the primary  network.  It  also  indicates  which  device  it  is bound to (or
Internal for  internal  networks)  and  the  Frame  Type if appropriate. Linux
supports 802.3,  802.2,  802.2  SNAP  and DIX (Blue Book) ethernet framing for
IPX.

The /proc/net/ipx_route  table  holds  a list of IPX routes. For each route it
gives the  destination  network, the router node (or Directly) and the network
address of the router (or Connected) for internal networks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certain aspects  of  kernel  behavior  can be modified at runtime, without the
need to  recompile  the kernel, or even to reboot the system. The files in the
/proc/sys tree  can  not only be read, but also modified. You can use the echo
command to write value into these files, thereby changing the default settings
of the kernel.
