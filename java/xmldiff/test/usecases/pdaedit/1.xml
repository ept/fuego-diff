    <h2>About Chess</h2>

    <p>Here is some information about chess in general (from the
    Chess FAQ by Steve Pribut). The FAQ can be found <a
    href="http://www.clark.net/pub/pribut/chessfaq.html">
    here</a></p>

    <h3 align="left">I'm a Novice (or Intermediate). How Do I
    Improve?</h3>

    <p align="left">There are lots of variations to the methods,
    but the things most good teachers agree on is to emphasize (1)
    tactics, (2) endings, and (3) playing with a plan. Most people
    spend too much time studying openings. Just learn enough about
    openings to get to a playable middlegame. The books listed
    below should give you a great start on (1), (2), and (3). Of
    course, playing experience is important. Review your games
    (with a much stronger player if possible) or your chess
    computer to find out what you did right and wrong. Seek out
    games against stronger players, and learn from them.</p>

    <p align="left">Some books are listed below to help in the
    quest to improve. You don't need to buy all these--pick and
    choose as you please. Buy one or two general works, a tactics
    book or two, and an endgame book.</p>

    <p align="left">You should also consider reviewing classical
    games by the masters: Capablanca, Tal, and others. Read over
    well annotated games.</p>

    <p align="left">If you are web oriented check the site of Jon
    Edwards, U.S. Correspondance Chess Champion's Home Page. This
    has a lot of introductory material on learning to play chess,
    some tactics and openings. Chess Primer &amp; Intro To ChessJon
    Edwards</p>

    <h3 align="left">Using Graphic Chess Symbols in Printed
    Text</h3>

    <p>There are a few ways of composing chess texts in
    international figurine notation (or including diagrams in
    printed text):</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Use a word processor or page-layout program and a chess
      font. For instance, for the Apple Macintosh there are at
      least 3 different sets of fonts usable with standard word
      processors like Microsoft Word, MacWrite, Nisus or WriteNow;
      or with page-layout programs like Illustrator or PageMaker.
      Most of these fonts are proprietary (you must purchase them).
      The fonts usually can be used for both the figurines and the
      diagrams. A freely available/usable PostScript font,
      including a variety of figurines, diagrams and _Informant_
      symbols, has been posted to "news:comp.fonts"comp.fonts and
      "news:rec.games.chess"rec.games.chess by Andy Walker
      ("mailto:anw@maths.nott.ac.uk"anw@maths.nott.ac.uk ).</li>

      <li>CC-Publisher (MS Windows) is another commercial
      chess-specific writing application. You must have MS Windows,
      a word processing package (Word, WordPerfect, AmiPro), and a
      chess database system (for generating diagrams--although this
      could be done by hand--like ChessBase or Zarkov). It comes in
      two versions. The basic version supports HP LJ-compatible
      laserjet printers ($49.95). The deluxe version supports any
      PostScript printer, and comes with PostScript Type I or
      TrueType fonts ($139.95). You get integrated utilities to
      move you from game-entry or diagram-creation to conversion
      and import into your word processor, with special Tips and
      Tricks for MS Word, Lotus AmiPro, and WordPerfect users.
      Extremely easy installation, and your fonts become available
      to all Windows applications. There's a comprehensive user
      manual on the installation disk, and you get free technical
      support! Chess Chow Publications, P.O. Box 3348, Church St.
      Station, New York, NY 10008. 212-432-6546. e-mail
      mginsbur@rnd.stern.nyu.edu</li>

      <li>Use the LaTeX chess macros and fonts package by Piet
      Tutelaers (see [18]). TeX is an advanced public-domain system
      for text formatting available on mainframes, workstations and
      personal computers. LaTeX is a set of text-formatting macros
      for TeX. METAFONT is a font generator program for TeX. For
      general information on all of these, and pointers to
      reference manuals, see the FAQ list posting in
      comp.text.tex.) Once you have the chess package, you'll need
      to 3a) be able to use METAFONT to generate chess fonts
      starting from the programs contained in the package; 3b) be
      able to install the LaTeX macros in your TeX system; and 3c)
      learn the macro language to format chess texts. Activity 3a
      can become tiresome if you do not have any help from a TeX
      wizard. Using LaTeX to write chess text is not very simple,
      but the results are worth the effort.</li>
